> Statistics is the science of making decisions under uncertainty
> --- 1954 - Leonard J. Savage, _The Foundation of Statistics_

The science of **statistics** deals with the collection, analysis,
interpretation, and presentation of data. We see and use data in our
everyday lives. The goal of statistics is not to perform numerous
calculations using the formulas, but to gain an understanding of your
data.

You are probably asking yourself the question, "When and where will I use 
statistics?" If you read any newspaper, watch television, check weather
forecast or use the Internet, you will see statistical information. There
are statistics about crime, sports, education, politics, and real estate.
Typically, when you read a newspaper article or watch a television news
program, you are given sample information. With this information, you may
make a decision about the correctness of a statement, claim, or "fact."
Statistical methods can help you make the "best educated guess." Since
you will undoubtedly be given statistical information at some point in
your life, you need to know some techniques for analyzing the information
thoughtfully. Think about buying a house or managing a budget. Think about
your chosen profession. The fields of economics, business, psychology,
education, biology, law, computer science, police science, and early
childhood development require at least one course in statistics.
