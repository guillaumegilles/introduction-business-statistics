Savage, The Foundation of Statistics\n\nThe science of statistics deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data. We see and use data in our everyday lives. The goal of statistics is not to perform numerous calculations using the formulas, but to gain an understanding of your data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niPhone Weather App\n\n\n\n\nYou are probably asking yourself the question, “When and where will I use statistics?” If you read any newspaper, watch television, check weather forecast or use the Internet, you will see statistical information. There are statistics about crime, sports, education, politics, and real estate. Typically, when you read a newspaper article or watch a television news program, you are given sample information. With this information, you may make a decision about the correctness of a statement, claim, or “fact.” Statistical methods can help you make the “best educated guess.” Since you will undoubtedly be given statistical information at some point in your life, you need to know some techniques for analyzing the information thoughtfully. Think about buying a house or managing a budget. Think about your chosen profession. The fields of economics, business, psychology, education, biology, law, computer science, police science, and early childhood development require at least one course in statistics.",

A model is therefore a mathematical tool to help us understand the world around us. It enables our limited brains to grasp real-life situations that are so complex they cannot be fully comprehended. Additionally, models introduce a layer of abstraction that provides a “simplified version of reality” (Gowers 2002).\nWhile this list is not exhaustive, most statistical models falls into at least one of these 3 categories (Kuhn and Silge 2022):",

For example, the goal of a clinical trial might be to provide confirmation that a new therapy does a better job in prolonging life than an alternative.\nInferential model uses probability to determine how confident you can be that your conclusions are correct.

Researchers often prefer to use quantitative data over qualitative (categorical) data because it lends itself more easily to mathematical analysis. For example, it does not make sense to find an average hair color or blood type.\nQualitative data also comes in 2 flavors:\n\nOrdinal: The categories of the variable can be arranged in a natural order, like school grades.\n\nNominal: Conversely, nominal qualitative values cannot be ranked in order, like hair color.",

    "text": "1.3 Where does data comes from?\n\n1.3.1 Population and Sample\nIn statistics, we generally want to study a population. You can think of a population as a collection of persons, things, or objects under study. To study the population, we select a sample.\nBecause it takes a lot of time and money to examine an entire population, sampling is a very practical technique. If you wished to compute the overall grade point average at your school, it would make sense to select a sample of students who attend the school. The data collected from the sample would be the students’ grade point averages. In presidential elections, opinion poll samples of 1,000–2,000 people are taken. The opinion poll is supposed to represent the views of the people in the entire country. Manufacturers of canned carbonated drinks take samples to determine if a 16 ounce can contains 16 ounces of carbonated drink.\nThe idea of sampling is to select a portion (or subset) of the larger population and study that portion (the sample) to gain information about the population.\n\nData are the result of sampling from a population. You can find more information in the  section of the appendices.\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Statistic and Parameter\nFrom the sample data, we can calculate a statistic. A statistic is a number that represents a property of the sample. For example, if we consider one math class to be a sample of the population of all math classes, then the average number of points earned by students in that one math class at the end of the term is an example of a statistic. The statistic is an estimate of a population parameter.\nA parameter is a numerical characteristic of the whole population that can be estimated by a statistic. Since we considered all math classes to be the population, then the average number of points earned per student over all the math classes is an example of a parameter.",

Then : 𝐸={{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6, 7}} is a partition of 𝐸 ; 𝐸={{1, 2}, {3, 4}, {5, 6, 7}} is a partition of 𝐸 ; 𝐸={{1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, {5}, {6}, {7}} is a partition of 𝐸 ; …\nSet of the parts:We call the set of the parts of 𝐴, the set of all the possible subsets of 𝐴. It is denoted 𝒫(𝐴).\nExemple : Suppose that 𝐴 = {1, 2, 3}. Then, we have: 𝒫(𝐴) = {∅, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}}\nCardinal of a set :The cardinal is the size of a set. The cardinal of a finite set is the number of elements of the set. In particular, the cardinal of the empty set is zero. Notation : |𝐸| (or #(𝐸), or Card(𝐸)) is the cardinal of the set 𝐸\nRecall that if 𝐴⊆𝐵, then |𝐴|≤|𝐵|; if 𝐴⊆𝐵, then |𝐵|=|𝐵|−|𝐴|; if 𝐴∩𝐵=∅, then |𝐴∪𝐵|=|𝐴|+|𝐵|; |𝐴∪𝐵|=|𝐴|+|𝐵|−|𝐴∩𝐵|; if |𝐴|=𝑛, then |𝒫(𝐴)|=2^𝑛.\n\n4.1.1 Combinatorial analysis\nThe purpose of combinatorial analysis (counting techniques) is to learn how to count the number of elements in a finite set.\nThree techniques will be addressed: Permutations Arrangements Combinations\nThese techniques depend on an operation: the factorial of a nonnegative integer.\nThe factorial :Let 𝑛 ∈ 𝑁. Its factorial is defined by :\n𝑛! = 1 × 2 × . . . × (𝑛 − 1) × 𝑛\nBy convention, we have 0! = 1. Main Property: Let 𝑘 be a nonnegative and non null integer (𝑘 ≥ 1) and let 𝑛 be a nonnegative and non null integer such that (𝑛−𝑘)≥0.\nWe have : 𝑛! = (𝑛 − 𝑘)! × (𝑛 − 𝑘 + 1) × . . . × (𝑛 − 1) × 𝑛.\nPermutations :Given a set 𝐸 of 𝑛 objects, a permutations is an ordered rearrangement, without repetition of these 𝑛 distinct objects. The number of permutations of 𝑛 objects equals 𝑛!\nArrangements : Given a set 𝐸 of 𝑛 objects (elements), we call arrangements of 𝑝 (1 ≤ 𝑝 ≤ 𝑛) objects, all ordered sequences of 𝑝 objects taken from the 𝑛 objects.\nThere are two cases:\nArrangements without repetition : When each object can only be seen once in an arrangement, the number of non-repeating arrangements of 𝑝 objects taken from 𝑛 is: 𝐴_𝑛^𝑝= 𝑛!/((𝑛−𝑝)!) where 1≤𝑝≤𝑛.\nArrangements with repetition : When an object can be observed several times in an arrangement, the number of arrangements with repetition of 𝑝 (1 ≤ 𝑝 ≤ 𝑛) objects taken from 𝑛 is equal to 𝑛^𝑝.\nRemark : The permutation of 𝑛 objects is a particular case of a non-repeating arrangement of 𝑝 objects taken from 𝑛 objects, when 𝑝 = 𝑛.\nThus, the number of permutations of 𝑛 objects equals :\n𝐴_𝑛^𝑛= 𝑛!/((𝑛−𝑛)!)=𝑛!/0!=𝑛!\nCombinations : Given a set 𝐸 of 𝑛 objects, we call combinations of 𝑝 (1 ≤ 𝑝 ≤ 𝑛) objects any set of 𝑝 objects taken  without replacement among the 𝑛 objects. In this case, the notion of order of objects is no longer taken into account. The number of combinations of 𝑝 objects taken from 𝑛 is\n𝐶_𝑛^𝑝= 𝑛!/(𝑝! × (𝑛−𝑝)!)=(𝐴_𝑛^𝑝)/𝑝!\n\n\n4.1.2 exemple détaillé\nHow many 10-letter words can be formed with the 26 letters of the alphabet if the letters can be reused ?\nAt each position (1 to 10) one can chose among 26 different letters. Therefore the number of possibilities will be : 26 × 26 × 26 × 26 × 26 × 26 × 26 × 26 × 26 × 26= 2610.\nHow many 10-letter words can be formed with the 26 letters of the alphabet if each letter is used only once ?\nThe number of arrangements without repetition of 10 objects taken among 26 is equal to 𝐴_26^10 = 26!/((26 − 10)!) = 26 × 25 × 24 × 23 × 22 × 21 × 20 × 19 × 18 × 17 =19 275 223 968 000 words.\nHow many different numbers of 6 digits are there\nIf there are no restrictions? If the numbers have to be divisible by 5 ? If the repetition of digits is excluded?\nThe first digit cannot be 0 otherwise the number would have 5 digits\nWithout any restriction One gets 9 × 10 ×10 ×10 ×10 × 10 = 900 000 possible numbers\nIf the number ends by 0 or 5 (divisible by 5) One gets 9 × 10 × 10 × 10 × 10 × 2 = 180 000 possible numbers\nIf a chosen digit cannot be re-used One gets 9 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 = 136 080 possible numbers.\n\n\n4.1.3 Exercice\nA padlock has three wheels, each with the digits 0 to 9. How many secrets “numbers” are there?\nFrom a set of 52 cards, two cards are drawn simultaneously (without replacement). In how many different ways is this possible?\nThe code on your laptop is made up of 4 numbers (ranging from 0 to 9 each). A criminal has observed you doing the code. He managed to see only one number (but he doesn’t remember its position). What is the (maximum) number of tries for the criminal to unlock your laptop?\nThe number of possibilities is equal to 10 × 10 × 10 = 103 = 1000\nIt corresponds to the number of different ways you can choose a pair of cards from a deck of 52 cards, that is 𝐶_52^2 =1326\nFirst, the number of possible ways one can place the known digit is equal to 𝐶_4^1 =4 And then, the number of possibilities for the remaining three digits is equal to 10 × 10 × 10 = 103 = 1000. Thus the (maximum) number of tries is equal to 4 × 1000 = 4000.\n\n\n4.1.4 Moodle extension\n\n4.1.4.1 1\nA code has five elements: three digits and two letters If the digits of the code are distinct, then the total number of possible codes is equal to : 20 x 10 x 9 x 8 x 26 x 26 10 x 10 x 9 x 8 x 26 x 26 10 x 10 x 9 x 8 x 26 x 25 10 x 9 x 8 x 7 x 26 x 26\nFeedback: We multiply the number of possibilities to place the 2 letters (therefore the 3 digits) among 5 positions: 𝐶_5^2 (= 𝐶_5^3 )=10 , by the number of arrangements without repetition of 3 (distinct) digits 10x9x8 by the number of arrangements with repetition of 2 letters 26x26\n\n\n4.1.4.2 2\nA code has five elements: three digits and two letters If the code begins with the digit 0, then the total number of possible codes is equal to : 26 x 26 x 10 x 10 10 x 26 x 25 x 10 x 9 6 x 26 x 26 x 10 x 10 10 x 26 x 25 x 10 x 9\nFeedback: If the code starts with 0, there are 2 numbers and 2 letters left to place.

There is a focus on verbs (e.g., fit, arrange, etc.) for general methods. Verb-noun pairs are particularly effective; consider invert_matrix() as a hypothetical function name.\nIn the context of modeling, it is also important to avoid highly technical jargon, such as Greek letters or obscure terms in terms. Names should be as self-documenting as possible.",
