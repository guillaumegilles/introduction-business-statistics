There are statistics about crime, sports, education, politics, and real estate. Typically, when you read a newspaper article or watch a television news program, you are given sample information. With this information, you may make a decision about the correctness of a statement, claim, or “fact.” Statistical methods can help you make the “best educated guess.” Since you will undoubtedly be given statistical information at some point in your life, you need to know some techniques for analyzing the information thoughtfully. Think about buying a house or managing a budget. Think about your chosen profession. The fields of economics, business, psychology, education, biology, law, computer science, police science, and early childhood development require at least one course in statistics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIncluded in this chapter are the basic ideas and words of probability and statistics. You will soon understand that statistics and probability work together. You will also learn how data are gathered and what “good” data can be distinguished from “bad.”",

Qualitative data are also often called categorical data. Hair color, blood type, ethnic group, the car a person drives, and the street a person lives on are examples of qualitative data. Qualitative data are generally described by words or letters. For instance, hair color might be black, dark brown, light brown, blonde, gray, or red. Blood type might be AB+, O-, or B+. Researchers often prefer to use quantitative data over qualitative data because it lends itself more easily to mathematical analysis. For example, it does not make sense to find an average hair color or blood type.\n[[illowskyintroductorystatistics2e2023]]\nQualitatives (categorial data) : données labellisées, comme faible, moyen, fort.

Quantitative data are the result of counting or measuring attributes of a population. Amount of money, pulse rate, weight, number of people living in your town, and number of students who take statistics are examples of quantitative data. Quantitative data may be either discrete or continuous.\nAll data that are the result of counting are called quantitative discrete data. These data take on only certain numerical values. If you count the number of phone calls you receive for each day of the week, you might get values such as zero, one, two, or three.\nData that are not only made up of counting numbers, but that may include fractions, decimals, or irrational numbers, are called quantitative continuous data. Continuous data are often the results of measurements like lengths, weights, or times. A list of the lengths in minutes for all the phone calls that you make in a week, with numbers like 2.4, 7.5, or 11.0, would be quantitative continuous data.\n(illowskyIntroductoryStatistics2e2023?)\n\nQuantitatives (continuous data) : données chiffrées.

    "section": "1.3 Key Terms",
    "text": "1.3 Key Terms\nindividual = people, things\nIn statistics, we generally want to study a population. You can think of a population as a collection of persons, things, or objects under study. To study the population, we select a sample. The idea of sampling is to select a portion (or subset) of the larger population and study that portion (the sample) to gain information about the population. Data are the result of sampling from a population.\nBecause it takes a lot of time and money to examine an entire population, sampling is a very practical technique. If you wished to compute the overall grade point average at your school, it would make sense to select a sample of students who attend the school. The data collected from the sample would be the students’ grade point averages. In presidential elections, opinion poll samples of 1,000–2,000 people are taken. The opinion poll is supposed to represent the views of the people in the entire country. Manufacturers of canned carbonated drinks take samples to determine if a 16 ounce can contains 16 ounces of carbonated drink.\nFrom the sample data, we can calculate a statistic. A statistic is a number that represents a property of the sample. For example, if we consider one math class to be a sample of the population of all math classes, then the average number of points earned by students in that one math class at the end of the term is an example of a statistic. The statistic is an estimate of a population parameter. A parameter is a numerical characteristic of the whole population that can be estimated by a statistic. Since we considered all math classes to be the population, then the average number of points earned per student over all the math classes is an example of a parameter.\nOne of the main concerns in the field of statistics is how accurately a statistic estimates a parameter. The accuracy really depends on how well the sample represents the population. The sample must contain the characteristics of the population in order to be a representative sample. We are interested in both the sample statistic and the population parameter in inferential statistics. In a later chapter, we will use the sample statistic to test the validity of the established population parameter.\nA variable, usually notated by capital letters such as X and Y, is a characteristic or measurement that can be determined for each member of a population. Variables may be numerical or categorical. Numerical variables take on values with equal units such as weight in pounds and time in hours. Categorical variables place the person or thing into a category. If we let X equal the number of points earned by one math student at the end of a term, then X is a numerical variable. If we let Y be a person’s party affiliation, then some examples of Y include Republican, Democrat, and Independent. Y is a categorical variable. We could do some math with values of X (calculate the average number of points earned, for example), but it makes no sense to do math with values of Y (calculating an average party affiliation makes no sense).\nData are the actual values of the variable. They may be numbers or they may be words. Datum is a single value.\nTwo words that come up often in statistics are mean and proportion. If you were to take three exams in your math classes and obtain scores of 86, 75, and 92, you would calculate your mean score by adding the three exam scores and dividing by three (your mean score would be 84.3 to one decimal place). If, in your math class, there are 40 students and 22 are men and 18 are women, then the proportion of men students is 2240 and the proportion of women students is 1840 . Mean and proportion are discussed in more detail in later chapters.",

    "text": "2.1 Qualitative Data Discussion\nBelow are tables comparing the number of part-time and full-time students at De Anza College and Foothill College enrolled for the most recent spring quarter. The tables display counts (frequencies) and percentages or proportions (relative frequencies). The percent columns make comparing the same categories in the colleges easier. Displaying percentages along with the numbers is often helpful, but it is particularly important when comparing sets of data that do not have the same totals, such as the total enrollments for both colleges in this example. Notice how much larger the percentage for part-time students at Foothill College is compared to De Anza College.\nDe Anza College | Foothill College |\n| Number | Percent | | Number | Percent|\n|-|——–|———|-|——–|——–| |Full-time | 9,200 | 40.9% | Full-time | 4,059 | 28.6% | | Part-time| 13,296| 59.1%| Part-time | 10,124 | 71.4% | |Total| 22,496 | 100% | Total | 14,183 | 100% |\n\nTables are a good way of organizing and displaying data.

Two graphs that are used to display qualitative (categorical) data are pie charts and bar graphs.\n\nIn a pie chart, categories of data are represented by wedges in a circle and are proportional in size to the percent of individuals in each category.\nIn a bar graph, the length of the bar for each category is proportional to the number or percent of individuals in each category. Bars may be vertical or horizontal.\nA Pareto chart consists of bars that are sorted into order by category size (largest to smallest).\n\nggplot()\n\nIt is a good idea to look at a variety of graphs to see which is the most helpful in displaying the data.

    "text": "2.4 Sampling\n\n2.4.1 Simple Random Sample\nGathering information about an entire population often costs too much or is virtually impossible. Instead, we use a sample of the population. A sample should have the same characteristics as the population it is representing. Most statisticians use various methods of random sampling in an attempt to achieve this goal. This section will describe a few of the most common methods.\nThere are several different methods of random sampling. In each form of random sampling, each member of a population initially has an equal chance of being selected for the sample. Each method has pros and cons. The easiest method to describe is called a simple random sample. Any group of \\(n\\) individuals is equally likely to be chosen as any other group of \\(n\\) individuals if the simple random sampling technique is used. In other words, each sample of the same size has an equal chance of being selected.\nFor example, suppose Lisa wants to form a four-person study group (herself and three other people) from her pre-calculus class, which has 31 members not including Lisa. To choose a simple random sample of size three from the other members of her class, Lisa could put all 31 names in a hat, shake the hat, close her eyes, and pick out three names. A more technological way is for Lisa to first list the last names of the members of her class together with a two-digit number:\n\n\n\nID\nName\nID\nName\nID\nName\n\n\n\n\n00\nAnselmo\n11\nKing\n21\nRoquero\n\n\n\n01 Bautista 12 Legeny 22 Roth 02 Bayani 13 Lundquist 23 Rowell 03 Cheng 14 Macierz 24 Salangsang 04 Cuarismo 15 Motogawa 25 Slade 05 Cuningham 16 Okimoto 26 Stratcher 06 Fontecha 17 Patel 27 Tallai 07 Hong 18 Price 28 Tran 08 Hoobler 19 Quizon 29 Wai 09 Jiao 20 Reyes 30 Wood 10 Khan\nLisa can use a table of random numbers (found in many statistics books and mathematical handbooks), a calculator, or a computer to generate random numbers. The numbers generated are as follows:\n\\[0.94360; 0.99832; 0.14669; 0.51470; 0.40581; 0.73381; 0.04399\\]\nLisa reads two-digit groups until she has chosen three class members (that is, she reads 0.94360 as the groups 94, 43, 36, 60). Each random number may only contribute one class member. If she needed to, Lisa could have generated more random numbers.\nThe random numbers \\(0.94360\\) and \\(0.99832\\) do not contain appropriate two digit numbers. However the third random number, \\(0.14669\\), contains \\(14\\) (the fourth random number also contains \\(14\\)), the fifth random number contains \\(05\\), and the seventh random number contains \\(04\\). The two-digit number \\(14\\) corresponds to Macierz, \\(05\\) corresponds to Cuningham, and \\(04\\) corresponds to Cuarismo. Besides herself, Lisa’s group will consist of Marcierz, Cuningham, and Cuarismo.\nBesides **simple random sampling*, there are other forms of sampling that involve a chance process for getting the sample. Other well-known random sampling methods are the stratified sample, the **cluster sample*, and the systematic sample.\n\n\n2.4.2 Stratified Sample\nTo choose a stratified sample, divide the population into groups called strata and then take a proportionate number from each stratum. For example, you could stratify (group) your college population by department and then choose a proportionate simple random sample from each stratum (each department) to get a stratified random sample. To choose a simple random sample from each department, number each member of the first department, number each member of the second department, and do the same for the remaining departments. Then use simple random sampling to choose proportionate numbers from the first department and do the same for each of the remaining departments. Those numbers picked from the first department, picked from the second department, and so on represent the members who make up the stratified sample.\n\n\n2.4.3 Cluster Sample\nTo choose a cluster sample, divide the population into clusters (groups) and then randomly select some of the clusters. All the members from these clusters are in the cluster sample. For example, if you randomly sample four departments from your college population, the four departments make up the cluster sample. Divide your college faculty by department. The departments are the clusters. Number each department, and then choose four different numbers using simple random sampling. All members of the four departments with those numbers are the cluster sample.\n\n\n2.4.4 Systematic Sample\nTo choose a systematic sample, randomly select a starting point and take every nth piece of data from a listing of the population. For example, suppose you have to do a phone survey. Your phone book contains 20,000 residence listings. You must choose 400 names for the sample. Number the population 1–20,000 and then use a simple random sample to pick a number that represents the first name in the sample. Then choose every fiftieth name thereafter until you have a total of 400 names (you might have to go back to the beginning of your phone list). Systematic sampling is frequently chosen because it is a simple method.\nA type of sampling that is non-random is convenience sampling. Convenience sampling involves using results that are readily available. For example, a computer software store conducts a marketing study by interviewing potential customers who happen to be in the store browsing through the available software. The results of convenience sampling may be very good in some cases and highly biased (favor certain outcomes) in others.\nSampling data should be done very carefully. Collecting data carelessly can have devastating results. Surveys mailed to households and then returned may be very biased (they may favor a certain group). It is better for the person conducting the survey to select the sample respondents.\nTrue random sampling is done with replacement. That is, once a member is picked, that member goes back into the population and thus may be chosen more than once. However for practical reasons, in most populations, simple random sampling is done without replacement. Surveys are typically done without replacement. That is, a member of the population may be chosen only once. Most samples are taken from large populations and the sample tends to be small in comparison to the population. Since this is the case, sampling without replacement is approximately the same as sampling with replacement because the chance of picking the same individual more than once with replacement is very low.\nSampling without replacement instead of sampling with replacement becomes a mathematical issue only when the population is small.\nWhen you analyze data, it is important to be aware of sampling errors and nonsampling errors. The actual process of sampling causes sampling errors. For example, the sample may not be large enough. Factors not related to the sampling process cause nonsampling errors. A defective counting device can cause a nonsampling error.\nIn reality, a sample will never be exactly representative of the population so there will always be some sampling error. As a rule, the larger the sample, the smaller the sampling error.\nIn statistics, a sampling bias is created when a sample is collected from a population and some members of the population are not as likely to be chosen as others (remember, each member of the population should have an equally likely chance of being chosen). When a sampling bias happens, there can be incorrect conclusions drawn about the population that is being studied.\nCritical Evaluation We need to evaluate the statistical studies we read about critically and analyze them before accepting the results of the studies. Common problems to be aware of include:\nProblems with samples: A sample must be representative of the population. A sample that is not representative of the population is biased. Biased samples that are not representative of the population give results that are inaccurate and not valid.\nSelf-selected samples: Responses only by people who choose to respond, such as call-in surveys, are often unreliable.\nSample size issues: Samples that are too small may be unreliable. Larger samples are better, if possible. In some situations, having small samples is unavoidable and can still be used to draw conclusions. Examples: crash testing cars or medical testing for rare conditions\nUndue influence: collecting data or asking questions in a way that influences the response\nNon-response or refusal of subject to participate: The collected responses may no longer be representative of the population. Often, people with strong positive or negative opinions may answer surveys, which can affect the results.\nCausality: A relationship between two variables does not mean that one causes the other to occur. They may be related (correlated) because of their relationship through a different variable.\nSelf-funded or self-interest studies: A study performed by a person or organization in order to support their claim. Is the study impartial? Read the study carefully to evaluate the work. Do not automatically assume that the study is good, but do not automatically assume the study is bad either. Evaluate it on its merits and the work done.\nMisleading use of data: improperly displayed graphs, incomplete data, or lack of context\nConfounding: When the effects of multiple factors on a response cannot be separated. Confounding makes it difficult or impossible to draw valid conclusions about the effect of each factor.\nVariation in Data\nVariation is present in any set of data. For example, 16-ounce cans of beverage may contain more or less than 16 ounces of liquid. In one study, eight 16 ounce cans were measured and produced the following amount (in ounces) of beverage:\n15.8; 16.1; 15.2; 14.8; 15.8; 15.9; 16.0; 15.5\nMeasurements of the amount of beverage in a 16-ounce can may vary because different people make the measurements or because the exact amount, 16 ounces of liquid, was not put into the cans. Manufacturers regularly run tests to determine if the amount of beverage in a 16-ounce can falls within the desired range.\nBe aware that as you take data, your data may vary somewhat from the data someone else is taking for the same purpose. This is completely natural. However, if two or more of you are taking the same data and get very different results, it is time for you and the others to reevaluate your data-taking methods and your accuracy.\n\n\nVariation in Samples It was mentioned previously that two or more samples from the same population, taken randomly, and having close to the same characteristics of the population will likely be different from each other. Suppose Doreen and Jung both decide to study the average amount of time students at their college sleep each night. Doreen and Jung each take samples of 500 students. Doreen uses systematic sampling and Jung uses cluster sampling. Doreen’s sample will be different from Jung’s sample. Even if Doreen and Jung used the same sampling method, in all likelihood their samples would be different. Neither would be wrong, however.\nThink about what contributes to making Doreen’s and Jung’s samples different.\nIf Doreen and Jung took larger samples (i.e. the number of data values is increased), their sample results (the average amount of time a student sleeps) might be closer to the actual population average. But still, their samples would be, in all likelihood, different from each other. This variability in samples cannot be stressed enough.\nSize of a Sample The size of a sample (often called the number of observations, usually given the symbol n) is important. The examples you have seen in this book so far have been small. Samples of only a few hundred observations, or even smaller, are sufficient for many purposes. In polling, samples that are from 1,200 to 1,500 observations are considered large enough and good enough if the survey is random and is well done. Later we will find that even much smaller sample sizes will give very good results. You will learn why when you study confidence intervals.\nBe aware that many large samples are biased. For example, call-in surveys are invariably biased, because people choose to respond or not.",

Then : 𝐸={{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6, 7}} is a partition of 𝐸 ; 𝐸={{1, 2}, {3, 4}, {5, 6, 7}} is a partition of 𝐸 ; 𝐸={{1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, {5}, {6}, {7}} is a partition of 𝐸 ; …\nSet of the parts:We call the set of the parts of 𝐴, the set of all the possible subsets of 𝐴.

Its factorial is defined by :\n𝑛! = 1 × 2 × . . . × (𝑛 − 1) × 𝑛\nBy convention, we have 0! = 1. Main Property: Let 𝑘 be a nonnegative and non null integer (𝑘 ≥ 1) and let 𝑛 be a nonnegative and non null integer such that (𝑛−𝑘)≥0.\nWe have : 𝑛! = (𝑛 − 𝑘)! × (𝑛 − 𝑘 + 1) × . . . × (𝑛 − 1) × 𝑛.\nPermutations :Given a set 𝐸 of 𝑛 objects, a permutations is an ordered rearrangement, without repetition of these 𝑛 distinct objects. The number of permutations of 𝑛 objects equals 𝑛!\nArrangements : Given a set 𝐸 of 𝑛 objects (elements), we call arrangements of 𝑝 (1 ≤ 𝑝 ≤ 𝑛) objects, all ordered sequences of 𝑝 objects taken from the 𝑛 objects.\nThere are two cases:\nArrangements without repetition : When each object can only be seen once in an arrangement, the number of non-repeating arrangements of 𝑝 objects taken from 𝑛 is: 𝐴_𝑛^𝑝= 𝑛!/((𝑛−𝑝)!) where 1≤𝑝≤𝑛.\nArrangements with repetition : When an object can be observed several times in an arrangement, the number of arrangements with repetition of 𝑝 (1 ≤ 𝑝 ≤ 𝑛) objects taken from 𝑛 is equal to 𝑛^𝑝.\nRemark : The permutation of 𝑛 objects is a particular case of a non-repeating arrangement of 𝑝 objects taken from 𝑛 objects, when 𝑝 = 𝑛.\nThus, the number of permutations of 𝑛 objects equals :\n𝐴_𝑛^𝑛= 𝑛!/((𝑛−𝑛)!)=𝑛!/0!=𝑛!\nCombinations : Given a set 𝐸 of 𝑛 objects, we call combinations of 𝑝 (1 ≤ 𝑝 ≤ 𝑛) objects any set of 𝑝 objects taken  without replacement among the 𝑛 objects. In this case, the notion of order of objects is no longer taken into account. The number of combinations of 𝑝 objects taken from 𝑛 is\n𝐶_𝑛^𝑝= 𝑛!/(𝑝! × (𝑛−𝑝)!)=(𝐴_𝑛^𝑝)/𝑝!\n\n\n4.1.2 exemple détaillé\nHow many 10-letter words can be formed with the 26 letters of the alphabet if the letters can be reused ?\nAt each position (1 to 10) one can chose among 26 different letters.

    "text": "Key Terms\nindividual = people, things\nIn statistics, we generally want to study a population. You can think of a population as a collection of persons, things, or objects under study. To study the population, we select a sample. The idea of sampling is to select a portion (or subset) of the larger population and study that portion (the sample) to gain information about the population. Data are the result of sampling from a population.\nBecause it takes a lot of time and money to examine an entire population, sampling is a very practical technique. If you wished to compute the overall grade point average at your school, it would make sense to select a sample of students who attend the school. The data collected from the sample would be the students’ grade point averages. In presidential elections, opinion poll samples of 1,000–2,000 people are taken. The opinion poll is supposed to represent the views of the people in the entire country. Manufacturers of canned carbonated drinks take samples to determine if a 16 ounce can contains 16 ounces of carbonated drink.\nFrom the sample data, we can calculate a statistic. A statistic is a number that represents a property of the sample. For example, if we consider one math class to be a sample of the population of all math classes, then the average number of points earned by students in that one math class at the end of the term is an example of a statistic. The statistic is an estimate of a population parameter. A parameter is a numerical characteristic of the whole population that can be estimated by a statistic. Since we considered all math classes to be the population, then the average number of points earned per student over all the math classes is an example of a parameter.\nOne of the main concerns in the field of statistics is how accurately a statistic estimates a parameter. The accuracy really depends on how well the sample represents the population. The sample must contain the characteristics of the population in order to be a representative sample. We are interested in both the sample statistic and the population parameter in inferential statistics. In a later chapter, we will use the sample statistic to test the validity of the established population parameter.\nA variable, usually notated by capital letters such as X and Y, is a characteristic or measurement that can be determined for each member of a population. Variables may be numerical or categorical. Numerical variables take on values with equal units such as weight in pounds and time in hours. Categorical variables place the person or thing into a category. If we let X equal the number of points earned by one math student at the end of a term, then X is a numerical variable. If we let Y be a person’s party affiliation, then some examples of Y include Republican, Democrat, and Independent. Y is a categorical variable. We could do some math with values of X (calculate the average number of points earned, for example), but it makes no sense to do math with values of Y (calculating an average party affiliation makes no sense).\nData are the actual values of the variable. They may be numbers or they may be words. Datum is a single value.\nTwo words that come up often in statistics are mean and proportion. If you were to take three exams in your math classes and obtain scores of 86, 75, and 92, you would calculate your mean score by adding the three exam scores and dividing by three (your mean score would be 84.3 to one decimal place). If, in your math class, there are 40 students and 22 are men and 18 are women, then the proportion of men students is 2240 and the proportion of women students is 1840 . Mean and proportion are discussed in more detail in later chapters.\n\nVariables\nA variable, usually notated by capital letters such as \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), is a characteristic or measurement that can be determined for each member of a [[statistics.population]]. Variables may be numerical or categorical:\n\nNumerical variables take on values with equal units such as weight in pounds and time in hours.\nCategorical variables place the person or thing into a category.\n\nIf we let \\(X\\) equal the number of points earned by one math student at the end of a term, then \\(X\\) is a numerical variable.

Qualitative data are also often called categorical data. Hair color, blood type, ethnic group, the car a person drives, and the street a person lives on are examples of qualitative data. Qualitative data are generally described by words or letters. For instance, hair color might be black, dark brown, light brown, blonde, gray, or red. Blood type might be AB+, O-, or B+. Researchers often prefer to use quantitative data over qualitative data because it lends itself more easily to mathematical analysis. For example, it does not make sense to find an average hair color or blood type.\n[[illowskyintroductorystatistics2e2023]]\nQualitatives (categorial data) : données labellisées, comme faible, moyen, fort.

Quantitative data may be either discrete or continuous.\nAll data that are the result of counting are called quantitative discrete data. These data take on only certain numerical values.

Continuous data are often the results of measurements like lengths, weights, or times. A list of the lengths in minutes for all the phone calls that you make in a week, with numbers like 2.4, 7.5, or 11.0, would be quantitative continuous data.\n(illowskyIntroductoryStatistics2e2023?)\n\nQuantitatives (continuous data) : données chiffrées.

    "text": "1.4 Sampling\n\n1.4.1 Simple Random Sample\nGathering information about an entire population often costs too much or is virtually impossible. Instead, we use a sample of the population. A sample should have the same characteristics as the population it is representing. Most statisticians use various methods of random sampling in an attempt to achieve this goal. This section will describe a few of the most common methods.\nThere are several different methods of random sampling. In each form of random sampling, each member of a population initially has an equal chance of being selected for the sample. Each method has pros and cons. The easiest method to describe is called a simple random sample. Any group of \\(n\\) individuals is equally likely to be chosen as any other group of \\(n\\) individuals if the simple random sampling technique is used. In other words, each sample of the same size has an equal chance of being selected.\nFor example, suppose Lisa wants to form a four-person study group (herself and three other people) from her pre-calculus class, which has 31 members not including Lisa. To choose a simple random sample of size three from the other members of her class, Lisa could put all 31 names in a hat, shake the hat, close her eyes, and pick out three names. A more technological way is for Lisa to first list the last names of the members of her class together with a two-digit number:\n\n\n\nID\nName\nID\nName\nID\nName\n\n\n\n\n00\nAnselmo\n11\nKing\n21\nRoquero\n\n\n\n01 Bautista 12 Legeny 22 Roth 02 Bayani 13 Lundquist 23 Rowell 03 Cheng 14 Macierz 24 Salangsang 04 Cuarismo 15 Motogawa 25 Slade 05 Cuningham 16 Okimoto 26 Stratcher 06 Fontecha 17 Patel 27 Tallai 07 Hong 18 Price 28 Tran 08 Hoobler 19 Quizon 29 Wai 09 Jiao 20 Reyes 30 Wood 10 Khan\nLisa can use a table of random numbers (found in many statistics books and mathematical handbooks), a calculator, or a computer to generate random numbers. The numbers generated are as follows:\n\\[0.94360; 0.99832; 0.14669; 0.51470; 0.40581; 0.73381; 0.04399\\]\nLisa reads two-digit groups until she has chosen three class members (that is, she reads 0.94360 as the groups 94, 43, 36, 60). Each random number may only contribute one class member. If she needed to, Lisa could have generated more random numbers.\nThe random numbers \\(0.94360\\) and \\(0.99832\\) do not contain appropriate two digit numbers. However the third random number, \\(0.14669\\), contains \\(14\\) (the fourth random number also contains \\(14\\)), the fifth random number contains \\(05\\), and the seventh random number contains \\(04\\). The two-digit number \\(14\\) corresponds to Macierz, \\(05\\) corresponds to Cuningham, and \\(04\\) corresponds to Cuarismo. Besides herself, Lisa’s group will consist of Marcierz, Cuningham, and Cuarismo.\nBesides **simple random sampling*, there are other forms of sampling that involve a chance process for getting the sample. Other well-known random sampling methods are the stratified sample, the **cluster sample*, and the systematic sample.\n\n\n1.4.2 Stratified Sample\nTo choose a stratified sample, divide the population into groups called strata and then take a proportionate number from each stratum. For example, you could stratify (group) your college population by department and then choose a proportionate simple random sample from each stratum (each department) to get a stratified random sample. To choose a simple random sample from each department, number each member of the first department, number each member of the second department, and do the same for the remaining departments. Then use simple random sampling to choose proportionate numbers from the first department and do the same for each of the remaining departments. Those numbers picked from the first department, picked from the second department, and so on represent the members who make up the stratified sample.\n\n\n1.4.3 Cluster Sample\nTo choose a cluster sample, divide the population into clusters (groups) and then randomly select some of the clusters. All the members from these clusters are in the cluster sample. For example, if you randomly sample four departments from your college population, the four departments make up the cluster sample. Divide your college faculty by department. The departments are the clusters. Number each department, and then choose four different numbers using simple random sampling. All members of the four departments with those numbers are the cluster sample.\n\n\n1.4.4 Systematic Sample\nTo choose a systematic sample, randomly select a starting point and take every nth piece of data from a listing of the population. For example, suppose you have to do a phone survey. Your phone book contains 20,000 residence listings. You must choose 400 names for the sample. Number the population 1–20,000 and then use a simple random sample to pick a number that represents the first name in the sample. Then choose every fiftieth name thereafter until you have a total of 400 names (you might have to go back to the beginning of your phone list). Systematic sampling is frequently chosen because it is a simple method.\nA type of sampling that is non-random is convenience sampling. Convenience sampling involves using results that are readily available. For example, a computer software store conducts a marketing study by interviewing potential customers who happen to be in the store browsing through the available software. The results of convenience sampling may be very good in some cases and highly biased (favor certain outcomes) in others.\nSampling data should be done very carefully. Collecting data carelessly can have devastating results. Surveys mailed to households and then returned may be very biased (they may favor a certain group). It is better for the person conducting the survey to select the sample respondents.\nTrue random sampling is done with replacement. That is, once a member is picked, that member goes back into the population and thus may be chosen more than once. However for practical reasons, in most populations, simple random sampling is done without replacement. Surveys are typically done without replacement. That is, a member of the population may be chosen only once. Most samples are taken from large populations and the sample tends to be small in comparison to the population. Since this is the case, sampling without replacement is approximately the same as sampling with replacement because the chance of picking the same individual more than once with replacement is very low.\nSampling without replacement instead of sampling with replacement becomes a mathematical issue only when the population is small.\nWhen you analyze data, it is important to be aware of sampling errors and nonsampling errors. The actual process of sampling causes sampling errors. For example, the sample may not be large enough. Factors not related to the sampling process cause nonsampling errors. A defective counting device can cause a nonsampling error.\nIn reality, a sample will never be exactly representative of the population so there will always be some sampling error. As a rule, the larger the sample, the smaller the sampling error.\nIn statistics, a sampling bias is created when a sample is collected from a population and some members of the population are not as likely to be chosen as others (remember, each member of the population should have an equally likely chance of being chosen). When a sampling bias happens, there can be incorrect conclusions drawn about the population that is being studied.\nCritical Evaluation We need to evaluate the statistical studies we read about critically and analyze them before accepting the results of the studies. Common problems to be aware of include:\nProblems with samples: A sample must be representative of the population. A sample that is not representative of the population is biased. Biased samples that are not representative of the population give results that are inaccurate and not valid.\nSelf-selected samples: Responses only by people who choose to respond, such as call-in surveys, are often unreliable.\nSample size issues: Samples that are too small may be unreliable. Larger samples are better, if possible. In some situations, having small samples is unavoidable and can still be used to draw conclusions. Examples: crash testing cars or medical testing for rare conditions\nUndue influence: collecting data or asking questions in a way that influences the response\nNon-response or refusal of subject to participate: The collected responses may no longer be representative of the population. Often, people with strong positive or negative opinions may answer surveys, which can affect the results.\nCausality: A relationship between two variables does not mean that one causes the other to occur. They may be related (correlated) because of their relationship through a different variable.\nSelf-funded or self-interest studies: A study performed by a person or organization in order to support their claim. Is the study impartial? Read the study carefully to evaluate the work. Do not automatically assume that the study is good, but do not automatically assume the study is bad either. Evaluate it on its merits and the work done.\nMisleading use of data: improperly displayed graphs, incomplete data, or lack of context\nConfounding: When the effects of multiple factors on a response cannot be separated. Confounding makes it difficult or impossible to draw valid conclusions about the effect of each factor.\nVariation in Data\nVariation is present in any set of data. For example, 16-ounce cans of beverage may contain more or less than 16 ounces of liquid. In one study, eight 16 ounce cans were measured and produced the following amount (in ounces) of beverage:\n15.8; 16.1; 15.2; 14.8; 15.8; 15.9; 16.0; 15.5\nMeasurements of the amount of beverage in a 16-ounce can may vary because different people make the measurements or because the exact amount, 16 ounces of liquid, was not put into the cans. Manufacturers regularly run tests to determine if the amount of beverage in a 16-ounce can falls within the desired range.\nBe aware that as you take data, your data may vary somewhat from the data someone else is taking for the same purpose. This is completely natural. However, if two or more of you are taking the same data and get very different results, it is time for you and the others to reevaluate your data-taking methods and your accuracy.\n\n\nVariation in Samples It was mentioned previously that two or more samples from the same population, taken randomly, and having close to the same characteristics of the population will likely be different from each other. Suppose Doreen and Jung both decide to study the average amount of time students at their college sleep each night. Doreen and Jung each take samples of 500 students. Doreen uses systematic sampling and Jung uses cluster sampling. Doreen’s sample will be different from Jung’s sample. Even if Doreen and Jung used the same sampling method, in all likelihood their samples would be different. Neither would be wrong, however.\nThink about what contributes to making Doreen’s and Jung’s samples different.\nIf Doreen and Jung took larger samples (i.e. the number of data values is increased), their sample results (the average amount of time a student sleeps) might be closer to the actual population average. But still, their samples would be, in all likelihood, different from each other. This variability in samples cannot be stressed enough.\nSize of a Sample The size of a sample (often called the number of observations, usually given the symbol n) is important. The examples you have seen in this book so far have been small. Samples of only a few hundred observations, or even smaller, are sufficient for many purposes. In polling, samples that are from 1,200 to 1,500 observations are considered large enough and good enough if the survey is random and is well done. Later we will find that even much smaller sample sizes will give very good results. You will learn why when you study confidence intervals.\nBe aware that many large samples are biased. For example, call-in surveys are invariably biased, because people choose to respond or not.",

Its factorial is defined by :\n𝑛! = 1 × 2 × . . . × (𝑛 − 1) × 𝑛\nBy convention, we have 0! = 1. Main Property: Let 𝑘 be a nonnegative and non null integer (𝑘 ≥ 1) and let 𝑛 be a nonnegative and non null integer such that (𝑛−𝑘)≥0.\nWe have : 𝑛! = (𝑛 − 𝑘)! × (𝑛 − 𝑘 + 1) × . . . × (𝑛 − 1) × 𝑛.\nPermutations :Given a set 𝐸 of 𝑛 objects, a permutations is an ordered rearrangement, without repetition of these 𝑛 distinct objects.

In this case, the notion of order of objects is no longer taken into account. The number of combinations of 𝑝 objects taken from 𝑛 is\n𝐶_𝑛^𝑝= 𝑛!/(𝑝! × (𝑛−𝑝)!)=(𝐴_𝑛^𝑝)/𝑝!\n\n\n5.1.2 exemple détaillé\nHow many 10-letter words can be formed with the 26 letters of the alphabet if the letters can be reused ?\nAt each position (1 to 10) one can chose among 26 different letters.

Thus, we can deduce that if the digits of the code are distinct, then the total number of possible codes is equal to: 10 x 9 x 26 x 26 6 x 10 x 9 x 26 x 26 12 x 10 x 9 x 26 x 26 4 x 10 x 9 x 26 x 26\nFeedback: We multiply the number of possibilities to place the 2 letters (therefore the 2 digits) among 4 positions: 𝐶_4^2=6 , by the number of arrangements without repetition of 2 (distinct) digits 10x9 by the number of arrangements with repetition of 2 letters 26x26\n\n\n5.1.4.6 6\nA code is made up of two digits and two letters of the alphabet in all possible orders. Thus, we can deduce that if the code begins with the number 0, then the total number of possible codes is equal to: 10 x 26 x 26 2 x 10 x 26 x 26 3 x 10 x 26 x 26 4 x 10 x 26 x 26\nFeedback: If the code starts with 0, there are 1 digits and 2 letters left to place. We multiply the number of possibilities to place the digit (therefore the 2 letters) among 3 positions: 𝐶_3^1 (𝐶_3^2 )=3 , by the number of possible digits: 10 by the number of arrangements with repetition of 2 letters : 26x26\n\n\n5.1.4.7 7\nA code is made up of two digits and two letters of the alphabet in all possible orders. Thus, we can deduce that if the code begins with the letter A, then the total number of possible codes is equal to : 26 x 10 x 10 x 2 26 x 10 x 10 x 3 26 x 10 x 10 x 4 26 x 10 x 10 x 6\nFeedback: If the code begins with A, there are 1 letter and 2 numbers left to place. We multiply the number of possibilities to place the letter (therefore the 2 digits) among 3 positions: 𝐶_31=(𝐶_32 )=3 , by the number of possible letters 26 by the number of arrangements with repetition of 2 digits 10x10\n\n\n5.1.4.8 8\nA code is made up of two digits and two letters of the alphabet in all possible orders. Thus, we can deduce that if the code starts with two letters, then the total number of possible codes is equal to : 26 x 25 x 10 x 10\n26 x 26 x 10 x 10\n26 x 25 x 10 x 9\n26 x 26 x 10 x 9\nFeedback: If the code starts with 2 letters, the positions of the 2 letters and the 2 digits are imposed.

    "text": "6.1 Philosohy\nThe tidyverse approach is to use function names that are descriptive and explicit over those that are short and implicit. There is a focus on verbs (e.g., fit, arrange, etc.) for general methods. Verb-noun pairs are particularly effective; consider invert_matrix() as a hypothetical function name.\nIn the context of modeling, it is also important to avoid highly technical jargon, such as Greek letters or obscure terms in terms. Names should be as self-documenting as possible.",
