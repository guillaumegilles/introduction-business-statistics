. Each student (selected for the study) is measured for height and weight.
Can we say (from this sample) that there is a link between student weight and height?

Each driver (selected for the study) is measured for age and the number of car accidents he or she has had.
Can we say (from this sample) that there is a link between age and the number of driver accidents?
Etc…

It is assumed in this lesson that two quantitative variables are measured simultaneously in a population. (For example: height and weight or age and number of accidents)

The goal remains the same as when we studied the Chi-square test, that is:
Study the possible link between these two variables.

In other words, the linear correlation coefficient test is used to study the existence or not of a link between two quantitative variables in a given population.

Modeling Framework :
Population
Variables studied simultaneously: X and Y real random variables (i.e. both variables are quantitative)
Postulate: the couple Z = (X,Y) has an « L » Distribution
Goal: to study the dependence between X and Y
The unknown value :   ρ (X,Y)

We want to test
H0 : ρ (X,Y) = 0
against
H1 : ρ (X,Y) ≠ 0

The above test is a two-tailed test. It allows us to implicitly study the link between two variables. In other words, the acceptance of H1 implies the existence of a link between the two variables.

We want to test
H0 : ρ (X,Y) = 0
against
H1 : ρ (X,Y) ≠ 0

It is assumed that (X,Y) follows a bivariate Normal distribution. This restriction is less restrictive when the sample size n is large enough (e.g. ≥ 30)

𝑥 ̅ is the mean of the variable X
𝑠*(𝑥 )is the standard deviation of the variable X
𝑦 ̅ is the mean of the variable Y
𝑠*(𝑦 )is the standard deviation of the variable Y

𝑟(𝑥,𝑦)=(𝐶𝑜𝑣 (𝑥,𝑦))/(𝑠*𝑥×𝑠_𝑦 )

Reminder Calculation of the Covariance
Data at a raw state : 𝐶𝑜𝑣 (𝑥,𝑦)=1/𝑛 ∑2*(𝑖=1)^𝑛▒〖𝑥*𝑖 𝑦_𝑖 〗 −(𝑥 ̅×𝑦 ̅)

Example :
In this example, we find :

𝑥 ̅=1624,8

𝑦 ̅=1658,4

𝐶𝑜𝑣 (𝑥,𝑦)=1/5(1624×1667+1625×1652+1622×1654+1613×1656+1640×1663−(1624,8×1658,4)=20,48

Reminder Calculation of the Covariance
Data in a contingency table : 𝐶𝑜𝑣 (𝑥,𝑦)=1/𝑛 ∑2*(𝑖=1)^𝑛▒〖〖𝑛*𝑖𝑗 𝑥〗*𝑖 𝑦*𝑖 〗 −(𝑥 ̅×𝑦 ̅ )

Example :

𝐶𝑜𝑣 (𝑥,𝑦)= 1/20[(5×1×1+1×(−0,25)×1+1×(−0,25)×1+2×(−0,25)×(−0,25)] −(0,3×0,55) = 0.06625

2. 2 The formulas to perform the test
   The following expression must be calculated:

Where

Decision rule: We reject H0 if |uobs | ≥ t, otherwise we do not reject H0
The rejection of H0 implies the acceptance of H1 and consequently we can deduce the dependence of the variables. The non-rejection of H0 does not necessarily imply the absence of a link between X and Y .

where
t is defined as follows F(t) = 1−𝛼/2, where F is the distribution function of the Student’s distribution, with
n-2 degrees of freedom

t is calculated from the Student’s distribution table.

Degrees of freedom = n-2

When the sample size is sufficiently large (e.g. ≥ 30), the decision rule for the test becomes:

We reject H0 if |uobs| > u , otherwise we do not reject H0

where
u is a real defined as follows F(u) = 1−𝛼/2, with F is the distribution function of the normal distribution

u is calculated from the table of the Normal distribution.

2. 3 Conclusion of the test

As a reminder, the test is written :
H0 : ρ (X,Y) = 0
against
H1 : ρ (X,Y) ≠ 0

H0 rejected : the data confirm that the two variables are not independent
 This implies that there is a link between the two variables

H0 not rejected : the data do not confirm that the two variables are not independent
 In other words, the data do not confirm a link between the two variables with an α% risk.

Let X be the net salary of women and Y the net salary of men in the same household. It is assumed that the couple (X,Y) follows a normal distribution. The two variables are studied on 15 households. The results are presented in the following table:

At the 5% risk, can we say that there is a link between salaries and gender?

The test is written:

    H0 : ρ (X,Y) = 0
    	against
    H1 : ρ (X,Y) ≠ 0

3. 3 Conclusion of the test

With a risk α = 5%, we reject the H0 hypothesis.

In other words, with a 5% risk, the data confirm that there is a link between women’s salary and men’s salary within the same household. So, there is a link between the salaries and the gender.

A famous brand specialized in the distribution of cultural and electronic products to the general public has commissioned a study from a firm specialized in marketing. The goal is to study the existence of a link between the amount spent and the age of the store's customers. A survey was conducted on a sample of 120 customers. Let 𝑥*𝑖 be the amount spent by the ith customer and 𝑦*𝑖 represent their age. We obtain the following results:

At 1% risk, can we say that the age and the amount spent are linked ?

The test is written:

    H0 : ρ (X,Y) = 0
    	against
    H1 : ρ (X,Y) ≠ 0

Let X be the variable dedicated to the amount spent
Let Y be the variable dedicated to the age of the client
