Définition
A random variable 𝑋 is called continuous if 𝑋(Ω) is an interval of ℝ, i.e 𝑋(Ω) has one of the following forms: 
]−∞,𝑎] , ]−∞,𝑎[ , ]𝑎,+∞[, [𝑎,+∞[ , 
]−∞,+∞[ ,]𝑎,𝑏[ ,[𝑎,𝑏[ ,]𝑎,𝑏],[𝑎,𝑏]où 𝑎<𝑏. 
Some examples :
 Time interval between 2 trains
 Hair length
 Lifetime in seconds of a mechanical part

Let  𝑋 be a continuous random variable and 𝑋(Ω) be the set of its possible values. 

Density function: 𝑓 : ℝ →ℝ is a density if it satisfies the following conditions: 
 For all 𝑥∈ℝ, 𝑓(𝑥) ≥ 0 
  ∫_(−∞)^(+∞)▒〖𝑓 (𝑥)𝑑𝑥〗= 1

Note that :
 For all 𝑥 ∈ℝ, ℙ(𝑋 = 𝑥) = 0 
 For all 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ℝ with 𝑎 < 𝑏, 
ℙ (𝑎≤𝑋≤𝑏)=ℙ(𝑋 ∈[𝑎,𝑏])= ∫_𝑎^𝑏▒〖𝑓 (𝑥)𝑑𝑥〗

Expectation :  𝔼(𝑋)=∫_(−∞)^(+∞)▒〖𝑥𝑓 (𝑥)𝑑𝑥〗
Variance : 𝕍(𝑋)=∫_(−∞)^(+∞)▒〖𝑥^2 𝑓 (𝑥)𝑑𝑥〗−(𝔼(𝑋))^2  
Standard deviation : a real positive value, denoted  𝜎_𝑋   defined by :
  𝜎_𝑋  = √(𝕍(𝑋) )  
Coefficient of variation : 𝐶𝑉 (𝑋) =  𝜎_𝑋/𝔼(𝑋) × 100 

Cumulative distribution function : denoted by  𝐹_𝑋, defined on ℝ and with values in [0,1]. 
For all 𝑥 ∈ ℝ 
𝐹_𝑋 (𝑥)=ℙ(𝑋 ≤𝑥)= ∫_(−∞)^𝑥▒〖𝑓 (𝑡)𝑑𝑡〗
Remarks 
 The cumulative distribution function is increasing 
 The cumulative distribution is a continuous function 

Linear transformation 
Let 𝑋 be a discrete random variable. Let 𝑎 and 𝑏 be two real values. 
We set 𝑌 = 𝑎𝑋+𝑏. 
We have :
 𝔼 (𝑌 ) = 𝑎 (𝔼(𝑋)) + 𝑏.
 𝕍 (𝑌 ) = 𝑎^2  (𝕍(𝑋)).
 If 𝑎 > 0, then 𝜎(𝑌 ) = 𝑎𝜎(𝑋)
 If 𝑎 < 0, then 𝜎(𝑌 ) = (−𝑎)𝜎(𝑋) 

Standard normal distribution  
One can say that a random variable 𝑋 follows a standard normal distribution, denoted by 𝒩(0, 1), if its density is defined by : 

𝑓(𝑥)=1/√2𝜋 𝑒^(−𝑥^2/2)

Standard normal distribution  
[[image normal distribution]]
By definition, the total area equals  1

Standard normal distribution  
 Shape of a bell. 
 𝑋(Ω)=ℝ, 𝔼(𝑋)=0 and 𝕍(𝑋) =1. 
 For all 𝑥∈ℝ, we have 𝑓(𝑥)=𝑓(−𝑥) (𝑓 is even). 
	Which implies that 𝑓 is a symetric function with respect to 𝑥 = 0. 

[[image normal distribution]]
Remark 1 
"Area" of the green part equals 1 - "Area" of the red part. 

[[image normal distribution]]
Remark 2
Based on the symmetric property of 𝑓(𝑥), "Area" of the left part (in yellow) is equal to the "Area" of the right part (in red). 

[[image normal distribution]]
Remark 3
"Area" of the blue part = "Area" of the grey part + "Area" of the blue part - "Area" of the grey part.

 "Area" of the green part in the first graph is equal to
𝐹_𝑋 (𝑢) =ℙ(𝑋 ≤ 𝑢) the cumulative distribution function of 𝑋 at 𝑢. 
 "Area" of the yellow part in the second graph is equal to 
𝐹_𝑋  (−𝑢)=ℙ(𝑋≤−𝑢) the cumulative distribution function of 𝑋 at −𝑢. 
 "Area" of the red part in the second graph is equal to ℙ(X > u). 
 One can deduce that 𝐹_𝑋 (𝑢) = 1 − 𝐹_𝑋 (−𝑢). 
  "Area"  of the blue part in the third graph is equal to
		 ℙ (𝑢 ≤ 𝑋 ≤ 𝑣) = 𝐹_𝑋  (𝑣) − 𝐹_𝑋  (𝑢) 
 It is difficult to calculate the values 𝐹_𝑋  (𝑢)=ℙ(𝑋 ≤ 𝑢) for any 𝑢. Thoses values are provided by a table.

[[tableau de la loi normale]] x2

Examples : Let 𝑋 a random variable which follows a standard Normal distribution. Use the table to calculate :
ℙ(𝑋 ≤ 2.12) = 0.983
ℙ(𝑋 ≤ −1.41) = 1 −ℙ(𝑋 ≤ 1.41) = 1 − 0.92073 ≃ 0.08 
Search the table for values closest to 95%, 99%, 97.5% and 99.5% and give each time the value of 𝑢 that corresponds. 
	Answers :
95% ← 𝑢 = 1.65 
99% ← 𝑢 = 2.33 
97.5% ← 𝑢 = 1.96 
99.5% ← 𝑢 = 2.58 

Normal distribution
Let 𝑚∈ℝ  and 𝜎>0. One can say that a random variable 𝑋 follows a normal distribution, denoted by 𝑋 ∼𝒩(𝑚, 𝜎), if its density is defined by :

𝑓(𝑥)=1/(𝜎√2𝜋) 𝑒^(−1/2 ((𝑥−𝑚)/𝜎)^2 )
 Shape of a bell.
 𝑋(Ω)=ℝ, 𝔼(𝑋)=𝑚 and 𝕍(𝑋) = 𝜎^2. 
 For 𝑚=0 and 𝜎=1, one can say that 𝑋 follows a standard Normal distribution. 
 If 𝑋∼𝒩(𝑚, 𝜎), then 𝑌=(𝑋−𝑚)/𝜎  follows a standard Normal distribution. 

Binomial – Normal approximation  : 
Let 𝑋 ~ℬ(𝑛, 𝑝). If 𝑛 is large (≥ 30) and 𝑝 is neither close to 0 nor to 1, such that 𝑛𝑝 > 10 and 𝑛(1 − 𝑝) > 10, then the binomial distribution can be approximated by a Normal distribution with parameters 
𝑚 = 𝑛𝑝 and 𝜎 = √(𝑛𝑝(1 − 𝑝)) 
that is : 
ℙ(𝑎≤𝑋≤𝑏)≈ℙ(𝑎≤𝑌 ≤𝑏)=𝐹_𝑌 (𝑏)−𝐹_𝑌 (𝑎) 
and : 
ℙ(𝑋 = 𝑎) =ℙ(𝑋 ≤ 𝑎) −ℙ(𝑋 ≤ 𝑎 − 1) ≈ 𝐹_𝑌  (𝑎) − 𝐹_𝑌  (𝑎 − 1) 
where 𝐹_𝑌 is the cumulative distribution function of 𝑌 ~ 𝒩(𝑛𝑝,√(𝑛𝑝(1 − 𝑝))). 

Poisson – Normal approximation  : 
Let 𝑋 ~ 𝒫𝑜(𝜆). If 𝜆 is large (> 20), then the Poisson distribution can be 
approximated by a Normal distribution with parameters 
 𝑚 = 𝜆 and 𝜎 = √𝜆, 
that is :
 ℙ(𝑎≤𝑋≤𝑏)≈ℙ(𝑎≤𝑌 ≤𝑏)=𝐹_𝑌 (𝑏)−𝐹_𝑌 (𝑎) 
and : 
ℙ(𝑋 = 𝑎) =ℙ(𝑋 ≤ 𝑎) −ℙ(𝑋 ≤ 𝑎 − 1)≈ 𝐹_𝑌  (𝑎) − 𝐹_𝑌  (𝑎 − 1) 
where 𝐹_𝑌 is the cumulative distribution function 𝑌 ~𝒩(𝜆,√𝜆).

applocation exercice
In 1955, Wechler proposed to measure the IQ (Intellectual Quotient) of adults with two scales for measuring verbal skills and non-verbal skills. The overall score of the person tested is compared with the distribution of scores obtained by a representative sample of the population of a given age, whose performances follow a Normal distribution with average 100 and standard deviation 15. 

 What is the percentage of people whose IQ is less than 80 ? 
 What is the probability of getting 
An IQ between 90 and 100 ? 
An IQ between 100 and 110 ? 
An IQ more than 110 ? 


Answers : 
Let 𝑋 be the random variable associated with the performance.  We know that 𝑋 ∼𝒩(100, 15). Therefore, 𝑌 =  (𝑋 − 100)/15  follows a standard Normal distribution
   ℙ(𝑋 ≤ 80) =ℙ(𝑌 ≤  (80 − 100)/15)
=ℙ(𝑌 ≤ −1.333) = 1 −ℙ(𝑌 ≤ 1.333) 
=  1 − 𝐹_𝑌  (1.333) = 1 − 0.9088 = 0.09121 


ℙ(90≤𝑋 ≤100) =ℙ((90 − 100)/15≤𝑌 ≤ (100 − 100)/15)
=ℙ(−0.6667 ≤ 𝑌 ≤ 0)=ℙ(𝑌 ≤ 0)− 𝑃(𝑌 ≤ −0.6667)
= 〖𝐹_𝑌  (0)−(1−𝐹〗_𝑌  (0.6667))=0.5−(1−0.7475) = 0.2475
 ℙ(100≤𝑋 ≤110) =ℙ((100 − 100)/15≤𝑌 ≤ (110 − 100)/15)
= ℙ (0 ≤ 𝑌 ≤0.6667)  =ℙ(𝑌 ≤0.6667)−ℙ(𝑌 ≤ 0)
= 𝐹_𝑌  (0.6667)− 𝐹_𝑌  (0)= 0.7475 − 0.5 = 0.2475 
 ℙ(𝑋 ≥110) =ℙ(𝑌 ≥ (110 − 100)/15)  =1−ℙ(𝑌 ≤  (110 − 100)/15)
=  1 − 𝐹_𝑌  (0.6667)= 1 − 0.7475 =0.2525

### Exercice with solution

Exercice 1

According to a study conducted by an insurance company: the distance in km before having the first accident follows a normal distribution of average 35000 and standard deviation 5000.

What is the percentage of drivers who have the first accident before 25000 km? 
What is the percentage of drivers who have the first accident between 25000 and 40000 km? 
What is the percentage of drivers who have the first accident beyond 45000 km? 
Calculate 𝑥, such that 𝑃 (𝑋 ≤ 𝑥) = 0.75.

Solution

Let 𝑋 be the random variable corresponding to the distance before the first crash. By assumption, we have 𝑋 ~ 𝑁 (35000, 5000) . We set 𝑌 =  (𝑋 − 35000)/5000. Thanks to this change of variable, we obtain that 𝑌 follows a reduced centered normal law.
 
 𝑃 (𝑋 ≤ 25000) = 1 − 𝑃 (𝑌 ≤ 2) = 0.02275
 𝑃 (25000 ≤ 𝑋 ≤ 40000) = 𝑃 (𝑌 ≤ 1) − (1 − 𝑃 (𝑌 ≤ 2)) = 0.81859
 𝑃 (𝑋 ≥ 45000) = 1 − 𝑃 (𝑌 ≤ 2) = 0.02275
We seek to calculate 𝑥 such that 𝑃 (𝑋 ≤ 𝑥) = 𝑃 (𝑌 ≤ (𝑥 − 35000)/5000)  = 0.75
	According to the table of the reduced centered normal law, it can be deduced that  :

(𝑥 − 35000)/5000  = 0.68 → 𝑥 = 38400

Exercice 2

The results of an evaluation test (scored out of 250) have an average of 200. These results follow a normal distribution whose variance is unknown. We know that the proportion of candidates who obtained a mark between 160 and 240 is equal to 95.44%. 
Calculate the variance of the results.

Solution

Let 𝑋 be the random variable corresponding to the test results. By assumption, we have that 𝑋 ~ 𝑁 (200, 𝜎). 
Let’s set 𝑌 =  (𝑋 − 200)/𝜎. Thanks to this change of variable, we obtain that 𝑌 follows a standard normal law. 
Moreover, we have :
𝑃 (160 ≤ 𝑋 ≤ 240) = 2 𝑃 (𝑌 ≤  40/𝜎) − 1 = 0.9544

This implies that 𝑃 (𝑌 ≤  40/𝜎) =0.9772. 

From the standard normal distribution table, we can deduce that

40/𝜎  ≈ 2 ⟹ 𝜎 ≈ 20⟹ 𝜎^2  ≈400

Exercice 3

Mr. Smith is elected with 51.3% of the votes. A survey is carried out at the exit of the meeting room where an investigator questions 1000 people chosen at random. Let 𝑋 be the random variable: “number of people who voted for Mr. Smith among the 1000 people questioned”.
 Determine the law of 𝑋.
 Calculate 𝐸(𝑋) and 𝜎(𝑋)
 Using an approximation that will be justified, calculate the probabilities of the following events:
𝑃 (𝑋 ≤ 500)
𝑃 (500 ≤ 𝑋 ≤ 520) 

Solution

Let 𝑋 be the random variable that represents the number of people who voted for Mr. Smith among the 1000 respondents (the number of successes among 1000 tries, with a probability of success 𝑝 = 0.513)

By definition, 𝑋 follows a binomial distribution with parameters 𝑛 = 1000 and 𝑝 = 0.513.
Thus, we have

𝐸(𝑋) = 𝑛 𝑝 =513 and 𝜎 (𝑋) = √(𝑉 (𝑋)) = √(𝑛 𝑝 (1 − 𝑝)) = 15.80604 ≈ 15.8

The conditions for approximation of the binomial law by a normal law (with parameters 𝑚=513 and 𝜎=15.8) are satisfied. Let  Y ~ 𝑁 (𝑚, 𝜎). We set 𝑍 =  (𝑋 − 𝑚)/𝜎.  Thanks to this change of variable, we obtain that 𝑍 follows a standard normal law.

So we get: 
𝑃 (𝑋 ≤ 500) ≈ 𝑃 (𝑌 ≤ 500) = 𝑃 (𝑍 ≤ −0.82) = 0.2061081
𝑃(500≤𝑋≤520)≈𝑃(500≤𝑌≤520)
                  =𝑃(−0.82≤𝑍≤1.44)=0.46

Exercice 4

What is the probability of getting 2 at least 1050 times in 6000 rolls of a (balanced) dice? 

Solution

Let 𝑋 be the random variable representing the number of twos one gets, among the 6000 die rolls (the number of successes among 6000 tries, with a probability of success p = 1/6)
 
By definition, 𝑋 follows a binomial distribution with parameters 𝑛 = 6000 and p = 1/6.
Thus, we have  :
 
𝐸(𝑋) = 𝑛 𝑝 =1000 and 𝜎 (𝑋) = √(𝑉 (𝑋)) = √(𝑛 𝑝 (1 − 𝑝)) = 28.86751 ≈ 28.87
 
The conditions for approximation of the binomial distribution by a normal distribution (with parameters 𝑚 = 175 and 𝜎 = 12.87) are satisfied. Let Y ~ 𝑁 (𝑚, 𝜎) . We set 𝑍 =  (𝑋 − 𝑚)/𝜎. Thanks to this change of variable, we obtain that 𝑍 follows a reduced centered normal law. 

Therefore : 
𝑃 (𝑋 ≥ 1050) ≈ 𝑃 (𝑌 ≥ 1050) = 1 − 𝑃 (𝑍 ≤ 1.73) ≈ 0.04181514
