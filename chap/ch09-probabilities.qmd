Practical approach:
Probability allows to measure the likelihood of an event.
Some definitions :
Random experiment: an experiment (involving chance) whose results can not be predicted with certainty
Universe: the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment, noted Ω
Event: a part or subset of the universe

Probability: a number between 0 and 1 that gives a measure of the likelihood of an event. In other words, if 𝐸 is an event, then

0 ≤ ℙ(𝐸) ≤ 1
Special cases of events:
Certain event: it can be described with all the elements of Ω and in that case its probability is 1
Impossible event: there exist no element of Ω which can describe it and in that case its probability is 0

Properties and basic operations:

Inclusion :
𝐴 ⊂ 𝐵 ⇒ ℙ(𝐴) ≤ ℙ(𝐵)
Intersection :
ℙ(𝐴 ∩ 𝐵) ≤ ℙ(𝐵) and ℙ(𝐴 ∩ 𝐵) ≤ ℙ(𝐴)
If ℙ(𝐴 ∩ 𝐵) = ℙ(𝐴) × ℙ(𝐵), then 𝐴 and 𝐵 are two independent events
If 𝐴 and 𝐵 are disjoint (i.e. 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵 = ∅ ), then ℙ(𝐴 ∩ 𝐵) = 0

Union :
ℙ (𝐴)≤ℙ(𝐴∪𝐵), ℙ(𝐵) ≤ ℙ(𝐴∪𝐵) and ℙ(𝐴∩𝐵) ≤ ℙ(𝐴∪𝐵)
ℙ(𝐴 ∪ 𝐵)= ℙ(𝐴)+ ℙ(𝐵)− ℙ(𝐴 ∩ 𝐵)
Therefore, if 𝐴 and 𝐵 are two disjoint events,
then ℙ(𝐴 ∪ 𝐵) = ℙ(𝐴) + ℙ(𝐵)
The difference :
(𝐴\∖𝐵) ⊂ 𝐴 ⇒ ℙ(𝐴\∖𝐵) ≤ ℙ(𝐴)
ℙ(𝐴\∖𝐵) = ℙ(𝐴) − ℙ(𝐴 ∩ 𝐵)
If 𝐴 and 𝐵 are two disjoint events, then (𝐴\∖𝐵) = 𝐴.
Therefore, one gets ℙ(𝐴\∖𝐵) = ℙ(𝐴).

Complementarity :
The complement of the event 𝐴 is an event (denoted 𝐴 ̅ or Ω\∖𝐴) that contains all elements of Ω not belonging to 𝐴

$$P(\overline{A}) = 1 - P(A)$$

Equiprobability

Assume that the universe $\Omega$ of a random experiment is a finite set. We talk of equiprobability when all the possible outcomes of the experiment have the same probability (of realization). Let $A$ be an event associated with this experiment. In that case, we have:

$$P(𝐴) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable cases}}{\text{Number of possible cases}}$$

The conditional probability

Let $A$ and $B$, two events from the same universe $\Omega$. Suppose that $A$ is a non-zero probability event. We call **conditional probability** of $B$ such $A$ (or knowing that $A$ is realized) the quantity defined as follows:

$$P(B \vert A) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)}$$

In the same way, the conditional probability of $A$ such $B$ (or knowing that $B$ is realized) is defined by:

$$P(A \vert B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$$

If $A$ and $B$ are two independent events, then:

$$P(A \vert B) = P(𝐴)$$

$$P(B \vert A) = P(B)$$

Total Probability Formula:

Let $\{𝐸1, ..., 𝐸_𝑘\}$ be a partition of $\Omega$ (such that 𝐸_𝑖 ≠ ∅ for all 𝑖 = 1,…,𝑘)
Let 𝐵 be an event. We have :

"ℙ" (𝐵)= ∑*𝑖

                     =∑_(𝑖=1)^𝑘▒〖"ℙ" (𝐸_𝑖 )" ℙ" (𝐵 ┤| 𝐸_𝑖)〗

With the external provider, 75% of the companies are satisfied.
With the use of internal resources, 90% of the companies are satisfied.

Consider the following events
A : company that uses an external provider
B : company that uses internal resources
S : satisfied company

What is the overall rate of satisfied companies :
"ℙ" (𝑆)="ℙ" *𝐴 (𝑆)× "ℙ" (𝐴)+"ℙ" *𝐵 (𝑆)×" ℙ" (𝐵)=0,81

What is the probability for a company to have used an external service provider knowing that it is satisfied :
"ℙ" *𝑆 (𝐴)="ℙ" (𝐴 ∩𝑆)/"ℙ" (𝑆) =("ℙ" *𝐴 (𝑆)×" ℙ" (𝐴))/("ℙ" (𝑆))=55,6%

We know that 35% of the employees of a company have taken traineeship A, 25% have taken traineeship B and 15% have completed both. An employee is randomly interviewed.
What is the probability that this person has taken at least one of the two traineeships?
What is the probability that this person has not taken any traineeship?
What is the probability that this person has completed one and only one of the traineeships?
An employee who has taken traineeship A is interviewed. What is the probability that this person has completed traineeship B as well?
An employee who has completed traineeship B is interviewed. What is the probability that this person has completed traineeship A as well?
Is taking traineeship A independent of taking traineeship B?

Consider the following events :
A = the employee has taken traineeship A : ℙ (A) = 0.35
B = the employee has taken traineeship B : ℙ (B) = 0.25
A ∩ B = the employee has taken both traineeships : ℙ(A ∩ B)=0,15

ℙ(A ∪ B)= ℙ(A)+ ℙ(B)− ℙ(A ∩ B)=0,45
ℙ((A ∪ B) ̅ )=1−ℙ(A ∪ B)=0,55
ℙ(A ∪ B)−ℙ(A ∩ B)=0,3
"ℙ" \_A (B) ="ℙ"(B | A) ="ℙ" (A ∩ B)/"ℙ" (A) =0,15/0,35=0,43
"ℙ" \_B (A)="ℙ" (A│B)="ℙ" (A ∩ B)/"ℙ" (B) = 0,15/0,25=0,6
ℙ(A ∩ B)≠ ℙ(A)× ℙ(B), therefore A and B are not independent

# 02 / proba / exercices

A company offers its employees two training courses:
Training A: team building
Training B: internal communication

We have the following information:
40% of employees have not taken any training
40% of employees have followed training A
35% of employees have followed training B

Calculate the probability of finding an employee who has taken both training courses simultaneously.
Calculate the probability of finding an employee who has followed one and only one training course
Calculate the probability of finding an employee who has followed both training courses simultaneously among the employees who have followed training B.
Can we say that there is a link between both training?

Training A : ℙ (A)=40%
Training B : ℙ (B)=35%
No Training : ℙ((A ∪ B) ̅ )=40%

⇒At least one" training": ℙ (A∪B)=1−ℙ((A ∪ B) ̅ )=60%

"Both trainings A and B : " ℙ (A ∩B)=ℙ(A)+ ℙ(B)−ℙ (A∪B)=15%

ℙ (A ∩B)≠ℙ(A)×ℙ(B)⇒ A and B are not independent

## [Can You Roll the Dungeon Master’s Dice?](https://thefiddler.substack.com/p/can-you-roll-the-dungeon-masters)

### This Week’s Fiddler

From Julien Beasley comes a coincidence of dice:

Two people are sitting at a table together, each with their own bag of six “DnD dice”: a d4, a d6, a d8, a d10, a d12, and a d20. Here, “dX” refers to a die with X faces, numbered from 1 to X, each with an equally likely probability of being rolled.

Both people randomly pick one die from their respective bags and then roll them at the same time. For example, suppose the two dice selected are a d4 and a d12. The players roll them, and let’s further suppose that both rolls come up as 3. What luck!

What’s the probability of something like this happening? That is, what is the probability that both players roll the same number, whether or not they happened to pick the same kind of die?

### Solution

Congratulations to the (randomly selected) winner from last week: 🎻 Nigel 🎻 from Sanderstead, England. I received 81 timely submissions, of which 60 were correct—good for a 74 percent solve rate. I was pleased to see a very healthy increase in the number of solvers as compared to two weeks ago. Way to bounce back, everyone!

Last week, two people were sitting at a table together, each with their own bag of six “DnD dice”: a d4, a d6, a d8, a d10, a d12, and a d20. Here, “dX” referred to a die with X faces, numbered from 1 to X, each with an equally likely probability of being rolled.

Both people randomly picked one die from their respective bags and then rolled them at the same time. For example, suppose the two dice selected were a d4 and a d12. The players rolled them, and both rolls come up as 3. What luck!

What was the probability of something like this happening? That is, what was the probability that both players rolled the same number, whether or not they happened to pick the same kind of die?

A good first step was to work out the probability of rolling each number. For example, what was the probability of rolling a 20?

To figure this out, many readers counted up the faces on all the dice. The d4 had 4 faces, the d6 had 6 faces, and so on. In total, there were 60 faces. Only one of these was a 20, which meant the probability of rolling a 20 was 1/60. Right?

Not quite. Why? By this logic, you had a 4-in-60 chance of picking the d4, a 6-in-60 chance of picking the d6, and so on. However, the puzzle said that each player picked a die at random, implying that each die had the same 1-in-6 chance of being selected. So the probability of rolling a 20 was not in fact 1/60. First, you needed to pick the d20 (a 1-in-6 chance) and then, given that you were rolling the d20, you needed to actually roll a 20 (a 1-in-20 chance). Combining these meant the probability of rolling a 20 was in fact (1/6)·(1/20), or 1/120. The probability was the same for rolling 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, and 13.

Meanwhile, your chances of rolling a 12 were greater, since there were two dice, the d20 and the d12, that could have resulted in a 12. As before, you had a 1-in-20 chance of picking the d20 and a 1-in-20 chance of then rolling the 12. But this time, you also had a 1-in-6 chance of picking the d12 and a 1-in-12 chance of then rolling a 12. Combining these cases meant the probability of rolling a 12 was (1/6)·(1/20) + (1/6)·(1/12), which simplified to 1/120 + 1/72, or 1/45. The probability was the same for rolling 11.

Continuing in this fashion (i.e., adding up the respective probabilities of the dice that could have resulted in each roll), you got the following:

The probability of rolling 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, or 13 was 1/120.

The probability of rolling a 12 or 11 was 1/45.

The probability of rolling a 10 or 9 was 7/180.

The probability of rolling an 8 or 7 was 43/720.

The probability of rolling a 6 or 5 was 7/80.

The probability of rolling a 4, 3, 2, or 1 was 31/240.

At this point, I’d like to quickly note that you were more likely than not to roll a 1, 2, 3, or 4, as this collective probability was approximately 51.7 percent. I found that a little surprising.

Okay, back to the puzzle. So far, we’ve worked out all the probabilities for one person’s roll. With two people rolling, you could determine the probability of each pair of rolls by creating a grid in which each row was one player’s roll and each column was the other player’s roll. Since the rolls were independent, the probability of the pair was the product of two respective probabilities.

Here’s what that grid looked like, with likelier pairs shown in yellow:

![](img/roll-dnd-dices.png)

A grid in a spreadsheet. There are 20 rows, numbered from 1 to 20, representing the roll of the first player. There are also 20 columns, representing the roll of the second player. The respective probabilities of each roll are also shown. In the grid are 400 cells, with each cell showing the product of the probability from its row and column. The cells are color-coded, so that higher values appear yellower. Cells along the main diagonal have a thicker black border.
The cells outlined in black along the main diagonal of the grid were precisely when both players rolled the same value. And so, the answer to the puzzle was the sum of these 20 cells, also known as the trace of the grid (or “matrix”).

The exact answer was 4(31/240)2 + 2(7/80)2 + 2(43/720)2 + 2(7/180)2 + 2(1/45)2 + 8(1/120)2, which simplified to 3/32, or 9.375 percent.

Several solvers, like Sameer G. of Ithaca, New York, neatly arrived at the same result with a little less computation. Sameer worked out the probabilities with which the players had the same roll, for each possible pair of dice they picked. For example, if both players picked a d4, the probability they had the same roll was 1/4. If one picked a d4 and the other picked a d6, the probability was now 1/6. In general, if the two dice were dX and dY, the rolls were the same with probability 1/max(X, Y). Computing the average probability across all 36 possible pairs for X and Y, Sameer arrived at the same result of 3/32. 

In the end, despite having six different dice to choose from, the probability that both players rolled the same number wasn’t too much less than it would have been if they had both rolled a standard die (i.e., d6). This was largely thanks to the fact that every die had the numbers 1 through 4, which accounted for the majority of the time the players had the same roll.
