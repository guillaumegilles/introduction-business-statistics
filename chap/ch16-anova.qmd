This test is used to study the link between a quantitative variable and a qualitative variable.

In the previous example:
the quantitative variable: sales
the qualitative variable: the Merchandising display system (with four modalities)
In other words, it means we need to examinate the null hypothesis: the means (of sales) of the four subpopulations (under each system) are identical.

The number of comparisons increases geometrically.
In our example, there are four Merchandising Display Systems, which means that we have six comparisons to make. If we consider an additional system, we will have ten comparisons to make, etc...

Inflation of the number of tests  increases the risk α.
Back to our example, we set α = 5%. For each comparison, we have a probability of 1 - α = 95% of accepting the hypothesis.
So a probability of (0.95)6 of accepting it 6 times. Which means a probability of 1 - (0.95)6 ≅ 0.27 of rejecting it at least once.
Advantages of the ANOVA Test (ANalysis Of VAriance) :
One test is enough
With a risk (5% for example) we can test the difference between the means

The limitation of the ANOVA Test:
We don’t know which averages are different

    	The "theoretical" conditions of application of ANOVA will not be discussed in this course

Let:

- k : the number of distinct groups (which corresponds to the number of modalities of the qualitative variable) and
  mj : the mean of the quantitative variable knowing the modality j of the qualitative variable (this is a conditional mean)
  In other words, mj is the unknown theoretical mean of the quantitative variable of the jth group

The purpose of the ANOVA test is to test:

    H0 : m1 = m2 = …. = mk
    	against
    H1 : At least 2 different means

2. 1 Notations

k = number of groups
nj = number of elements in the jth group
n = the total number of elements
xi,j = the value measured for the ith element of the jth group. i varies from 1 to nj and j varies from 1 to k
The average of the jth group :

The total average :

2. 2 The formulas to perform the test
   The interclass Average Square (A.S.inter) :

The intraclass Average Square (A.S.intra)

2. 3 Calculation of Uobs

Decision rule: We reject H0 if uobs ≥ f, otherwise we do not reject H0

where
f is defined as follows F(f) = 1- α, with F is the distribution function of the Fisher distribution with
v1 = k - 1 and v2 = n - k degrees of freedom

f is calculated from the Fisher Distribution. Note that for each fixed α, there is a specific table. In this course, we have the table of the Fisher distribution for α = 5%

The Table of the
Fisher Distribution
for α = 5%.

v1 = k – 1
v2 = n – k

2. 4 Conclusion of the test

H0 rejected: the data confirm that all means are not equal (that there is at least one different mean)
 This implies that there is a link between the two criteria studied

H0 not rejected: the data do not confirm that all means are not equal (we can not confirm that there is at least
one different average from the others)

3.1 Notations

k = number of groups = (A1, A2, A3 et A4) = 4
n1 = number of elements in group A1 = 5
n2 = number of elements in group A2 = 5
n3 = number of elements in group A3 = 5
n4 = number of elements in group A4 = 5
n = total number of éléments = n1 + n2 + n3 + n4 = 5 + 5 +5 +5 = 20
(𝑥_1 ) ̅=(120+118+122+110+130)/5=120 is the average sales for A1 (Shelf end)
(𝑥_2 ) ̅=(122+120+132+124+112)/5=122 is the average sales for A2 (Lower Shelf end)
(𝑥_3 ) ̅=(116+108+116+116+124)/5=116 is the average sales for A3 (Upper floor)
(𝑥_4 ) ̅=(122+114+122+122+130)/5=122 is the average sales for A4 (Lower floor)
𝑥 ̿=(120+118+…+122+130)/20=120 is the average total sales

3. 3 Calculation of Uobs

According to the Fisher Distribution table with α = 5%.
v1 = k – 1 = 4 – 1 = 3
v2 = n – k = 20 – 4 = 16

    							So we have

3. 4 Conclusion of the test

With a risk α = 5%, the hypothesis H0 is not rejected
In other words, the data do not confirm that the average sales under the four Merchandising Display Systems are different.
In other words, the data does not confirm that the 4 Merchandising Dislpay systems (Gondola, lower gondola, eye level and stoop level) has an effect on sales.

The following table presents measurements of the height (in mm) of a plant (a fern), made in several different environments in France, on randomly sampled samples.
A researcher wants to compare these data to find out the effect of environment on plant size.

Can we say, with a 5% risk, that the environment has an influence on the size of the fern?

Let 5 be the number of distinct environments:
Env 1 : Mediterranean Coast
Env 2 : The Alps
Env 3 : Hautes-De-France
Env 4 : South Atlantic coast
Env 5 : Brittany

The ANOVA test is written as follows:

    H0 : m1 = m2 = m3  = m4
    	against
    H1 : At least 2 different means

4.1 Notations

n1 = number of measurements in Env1 = 8
n2 = number of measurements in Env2 = 5
n3 = number of measurements in Env3 = 6
n4 = number of measurements in Env4 = 5
n5 = number of measurements in Env5 = 7
n = the total number of measures = n1 + n2 + n3 + n4 + n5 = 8 + 5 + 6 + 5 + 7 = 31

(𝑥_1 ) ̅=(112+115+112+118+124+132+131+115)/8=119,875 is the average height of the plant in Env1
(𝑥_2 ) ̅=(141+146+135+147+154)/5=144,6 is the average height of the plant in Env2

A data analyst at a business school (in France) is trying to determine whether the academic performance of first-year students is a function of their type of bachelor's degrees (Bac ES, Bac S or Bac STG).
To do that, he observes the performance of 18 first-year students, 7 of whom come from a Bac ES, 6 from a Bac S and 5 from a Bac STG. Performance is measured by the average of all the subjects taken by the students:

Can we say, with a 5% risk, that the types of bachelor's degrees do not have the same effects on the academic performance of first-year students?

Let 3 be the number of groups: (There are 3 different BAC)
Bac 1 : ES
Bac 2 : S
Bac 3 : STG

The ANOVA test is written as follows:

    H0 : m1 = m2 = m3  = m4
    	against
    H1 : At least 2 different means

1. Notations

k = number of groups = (Bac ES, Bac S, Bac STG) = 3
n1 = number of students coming from a Bac ES = 7
n2 = number of students coming from a Bac S = 6
n3 = number of students coming from a Bac STG = 5
n = the total number of students = n1 + n2 + n3 = 7 + 6 + 5 = 18

(𝑥_1 ) ̅=(77+68+96+82+84+75+100)/7=83,14 is the average performance of 1st year students from a Bac ES
(𝑥_2 ) ̅=(85+71+91+93+100+85)/6=87,5 is the average performance of 1st year students from a Bac S
(𝑥_3 ) ̅=(60+6575+75+80)/5=71 is the average performance of 1st year students from a Bac STG
𝑥 ̿=(77+68+…+75+80)/18=81,22 is the total average of the students' 1st year performance (regardless of their BAC)

4. Conclusion of the test

With a risk α = 5%, the hypothesis H0 is rejected

In other words, the data confirm that there is at least one different average.

In other words, the data allow us to confirm with a 5% error that the type of bachelor’s degrees has an influence on the academic performance of first-year students.
