Assertion :

In logic, an assertion is a sentence to which we can assign a truth value (true or false). In other words, an assertion can be either true or false (but never both)

Examples :

"18 is divisible by 9" is a true statement
"π is an integer" is a false statement

Negation of an assertion :

If an assertion is true, its negation is false
If an assertion is false, its negation is true

Examples :

P: "1000 is less than or equal to 500“ no(P): "1000 is strictly greater than 500
P : « 2^2=4 »  no(P) : « 2^2≠4 »

Defense strategy (attorney):

The goal is to show that her client is innocent/not guilty

She starts by assuming that her client is guilty!!!

But guilt implies certain characteristics or evidence:
She seeks to find a contradiction

Presumption of innocence:

"Any person suspected or prosecuted is presumed innocent until proven guilty."
"The accused is presumed innocent and that doubt must benefit him".
"Everyone has the right to respect for the presumption of innocence."
The trial consists of gathering and presenting evidence to invalidate the "not guilty" of the accused

Accept the error!!!

A coin is tossed 10 times in a row and lands on its head 10 times in a row

This seems to be very strong evidence to conclude that the piece is biased

There is almost one chance in a thousand that this will happen even if the
if the room is balanced

When making decisions, the goal is not to eliminate errors, but to minimize them.

Logical conclusion

The rejection of guilt implies the non-guilt of the defendant

The non-rejection of guilt implies that we do not have elements that allow us to confirm the non-guilt of the accused

It does not confirm guilt

The quality manager of a factory confirms that during the year 2019, the average daily number of defective parts is equal to 4.

The quality manager has asked (at the beginning of 2020) a team of specialized technicians to intervene in order to make some adjustments to the parameters of the production machines.

The quality manager is now wondering if, following the intervention of the team of technicians, the current situation :

Has evolved / changed
became worse (i.e., the intervention was not beneficial)
Has improved (i.e., the intervention was beneficial)

To answer the quality manager's questions, simply compare the current average daily number of defective parts with 4

Transforming the problem into a modeling framework:

Population : the days (of activity of the plant) after the intervention of the technicians

Studied variable : the number of defective parts

Modeling assumption : the variable studied, noted 𝑋, follows a probability distribution "𝔏"

Unknown parameter(s) : 𝑚=𝔼(𝑋) and 𝜎= 𝜎(𝑋)

Reference information : a reference average 𝑚_0=4

The quality manager's questions can be translated as follows:

The current situation has changed  𝒎 ≠𝒎*𝟎=𝟒
The current situation has become worse  𝒎>𝒎*𝟎=𝟒
The current situation has improved  𝒎<𝒎_𝟎=𝟒

[...]

Approach 1:

If we have perfect knowledge of the distribution "𝔏", then the problem becomes purely "probabilistic"

Simply calculate 𝑚=𝔼(𝑋) and compare this to the reference mean 𝑚_0

Approach 2:

We can proceed by census: in other words, study the unknown parameter(s) on the whole population

Approach 3:

We can proceed by sampling: in other words, study the unknown parameter(s) on a part of the population

Remark :

Given that perfect knowledge of the "𝕷" distribution is rather utopian.
The sampling procedure is often preferred for processing

This procedure allows to bypass a number of difficulties / disadvantages of the census procedure:

Accessibility to the entire population
The cost
The time
…

The "reliability" of this procedure obviously depends on the "selection quality" of the individuals and the number of individuals.

Thus, we proceed by sampling. We therefore have a "data set" associated with the variable under study, of size 𝑛 (sufficiently large)

Step 1 : calculation of the (empirical) test statistic

Where 𝑥 ̅ is the empirical mean, 𝑠_𝑥 is the empirical standard deviation, and 𝑚_0 is the reference average.

Observations / realizations of a "theoretical" sample

The quality manager of a factory confirms that during the year 2019, the average daily number of defective parts is equal to 4.

The quality manager has asked (at the beginning of 2020) a team of specialized technicians to intervene in order to make some adjustments to the parameters of the production machines.

The quality manager is now wondering whether the current situation has changed after the intervention of the team of technicians. To do this, the quality manager chose (randomly) 50 days after the intervention and took the number of defective parts. This study gave a mean of 3.82 and a standard deviation of 1.80765.

Can we say, with a 25% risk, that the average daily number of defective parts of defective parts has decreased?

Can we say, with a 5% risk, that the average daily number of defective parts has decreased?

Modeling framework:

Population : the days (of activity of the plant) after the intervention of the technicians

Studied variable : the number of defective parts

Modeling assumption : the variable studied, noted 𝑋, follows a probability distribution "𝔏"

Unknown parameter(s) : 𝑚=𝔼(𝑋) and 𝜎= 𝜎(𝑋)

Reference information : a reference average 𝑚_0=4

Test formulation:

[...]

The quality manager of a factory confirms that during the year 2019, the rate of defective parts produced by machine M is equal to 2%.

The quality manager asked (at the beginning of 2020) a team of specialized technicians to intervene in order to make some adjustments to the parameters of the M machine.

The quality manager is now wondering if, following the intervention of the team of technicians, the current situation :

Has evolved / changed
became worse (i.e., the intervention was not beneficial)
Has improved (i.e., the intervention was beneficial)

To answer the quality manager's questions, simply compare the current rate of defective parts with 2%.

The population : The parts produced by the M machine (post intervention)
The studied variable : 𝑋 (Ω)= {1 (𝑑𝑒𝑓𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒) ; 0 (𝑛𝑜𝑡 𝑑𝑒𝑓𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒)}
Modeling assumption : The studied variable, noted X, follows a Bernoulli distribution of parameter  
𝑝 = ℙ(𝑋 = 1)
Unknown parameter(s) : 𝑝
Reference information : a reference proportion 𝑝_0=2%

The quality manager's questions can be translated as follows:

The current situation has changed  𝒑≠𝒑*𝟎=𝟐%
The current situation has become worse  𝐩>𝒑*𝟎=𝟐%
The current situation has improved  𝐩<𝒑_𝟎=𝟐%

A tire manufacturer claims that the average life of a new type of tire, rated NP, is 75,000 km under certain conditions. The new quality manager at the manufacturer's plant wanted to check this information. To do this, he randomly selected 50 NP tires and studied their lifetimes under the same conditions mentioned by the manufacturer. This study gave an average life equal to 80,000 km and a standard deviation equal to 2,500 km.

Question 1 :

Can we confirm, with a 5% risk, that the manufacturer is wrong?

Question 2 :

Can we confirm, with a 1% risk, that the manufacturer is wrong?

Modeling framework:

- Population : NP tires
- Studied variable : the lifetime
- Modeling assumption : the variable studied, noted 𝑋, follows a probability distribution "𝔏"
- Unknown parameter(s) : 𝑚=𝔼(𝑋) and 𝜎= 𝜎(𝑋)

Empirical results :

The empirical mean (estimate of m) : 𝑥 ̅ = 80000
The empirical standard deviation (estimate of σ) : s = 2500
The size of the data set : n = 50 (> 30)
Reference average : 𝑚_0=75000

We wish to carry out a two-tailed test of the conformity of a mean with respect to a reference value / mean.
The (empirical) test statistic : 𝑢_𝑜𝑏𝑠=2

Question 1 :

Can we confirm, with a 5% risk (then 1%), that the average amount of taxes is less than 1550 euros?

Question 2 :

Can we confirm, with a 5% risk, that more than half of the taxpayers pay more than 1500 euros in taxes?

Question 1

Modeling framework:

Population : taxpayers
Studied variable : the amount of taxes (to be paid)
Modeling assumption : the variable studied, noted 𝑋, follows a probability distribution "𝔏"

- Unknown parameter(s) : 𝑚=𝔼(𝑋) and 𝜎= 𝜎(𝑋)

Empirical results :

The empirical mean (estimate of m) : 𝑥 ̅ = 1510
The empirical standard deviation (estimate of σ) : s = 391.0243
The size of the data set : n = 300 (> 30)

Reference information : a reference average 𝑚_0=1550

We wish to perform a one-tailed left-handed test of the conformity of a mean with respect to a reference value / mean.

Question 1

Calculation of the (empirical) test statistic:
𝑢_𝑜𝑏𝑠=−1.771809

With 𝛼=5%, we have 𝑢^∗=1.645. It implies that 𝑢_𝑜𝑏𝑠<− 𝑢^∗
Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis.

In other words, the data allows us to confirm, with a 5% risk, that the average amount of taxes is less than 1550 euros

With 𝛼=1%, we have 𝑢^∗=2.33. It implies that 𝑢_𝑜𝑏𝑠>− 𝑢^∗
Therefore, we do not reject the null hypothesis.

In other words, the data do not allow us to confirm, with a 1% risk, that the average amount of taxes is less than 1550 euros

Question 2 :

Modeling framework:

Population : taxpayers
Studied variable : 𝑋 (Ω)= {1 (𝑡𝑎𝑥 𝑎𝑚𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡≥1500) ; 0 (𝑡𝑎𝑥 𝑎𝑚𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡<1500)}  
Modeling assumption : The studied variable, noted X, follows a Bernoulli distribution of parameter 𝑝 = ℙ(𝑋 = 1)
Unknown parameter(s) : 𝑝
Reference value : 𝑝_0=0.5

Empirical results :

The size of the data set : n = 300 (> 30)
k (number of favorable cases) = 150 + 18
An estimate for p is given by
𝑝 ̂ = (150+18)/300 = 0.56

We wish to perform a one-tailed right test of the conformity of a proportion to a reference value/proportion.

Calculation of the (empirical) test statistic:
𝑢_𝑜𝑏𝑠=2.078461

With 𝛼=5%, we have 𝑢^∗=1.645. It implies that 𝑢_𝑜𝑏𝑠> 𝑢^∗
Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis.

In other words, the data allow us to confirm, with a 5% risk, that the rate of taxpayers who pay more than 1500 euros in taxes is higher than 50%.

Exercise 1 :

The quality department of a factory claims that the percentage of defective parts is less than 3%. A data set of 150 parts taken randomly from the production line shows that there are 147 parts that meet the standards.
Thus, we can deduce that :

Defective parts represent the study population
A. True
B. False  
Feedback : the population is the set of items.

The variable studied is the number of defective parts
A. True
B. False  
Feedback : the studied variable follows a Bernoulli distribution whose success is the fact that the part is defective

3. 2% is the rate of defective parts
   A. True
   B. False  
   Feedback : 2% is the empirical proportion of defective parts

4. To prove that the quality department is right, a one-tailed left-handed test of the conformity of a proportion to a reference value must be performed
   A. True
   B. False  
   Feedback : we put in the alternative hypothesis what we want to demonstrate

5. The data allows us, with a 5% risk, to confirm that the quality department is right
   A. True
   B. False  
   Feedback : After checking the calculations (using the formula for finding the test statistic associated with a test of conformity of a proportion with respect to a reference value) we see that there is no rejection of the initial hypothesis (with 5% risk) ....

Exercise 2

Plant U produces cereal boxes. The plant's quality control department determines that the average net weight of a cereal box should not be less than 200 g. In order to check for a possible malfunction, the head of the quality control department randomly took 100 boxes from the production line and measured their weight. This study gave an average weight of 203 g and a standard deviation of 15 g.

Thus, it can be deduced that:

1. To check if the average weight of the boxes respects the standard, we have to carry out a left one-tailed test of conformity of an average compared to a reference value
   A. True
   B. False  
   Feedback : we put in the alternative hypothesis what we want to demonstrate

2. The data do not allow us, with a 5% risk, to confirm that the average weight of the boxes meets the standard.
   A. True
   B. False  
   Feedback : After checking the calculations (using the formula for finding the test statistic associated with a test of conformity of a mean with respect to a reference value) we find that the initial hypothesis is rejected (with a 5% risk)....

Exercise 2

3. The data allows us, with a 1% risk, to confirm that the average weight of the boxes respects the norm.
   A. True
   B. False  
   Feedback : After checking the calculations (using the formula for finding the test statistic associated with a test of conformity of a mean with respect to a reference value) we see that there is no rejection of the initial hypothesis (with a 1% risk)....
