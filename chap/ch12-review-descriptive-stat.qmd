Univariate data

Bivariate data

The objective of this session is to perform a reminder of some numerical summaries associated with describing the data. These numerical summaries were covered during the "data description" course (first year, semester 2)Mastering these calculations is essential for the rest of the course.Note that in this session we do not impose any "probabilistic hypothesis" on the data. In other words, we are only interested in the description of the data through the numerical summaries without taking into account the existence of a probability law related to these data.

Individual (an element of the population
Population: a set of elements sharing one or more characteristics that serve to group them together
Population is said to be finite if we can determine the exact number of its individuals (otherwise it is said to be infinite)

Variable
qualitative
nominal
ordinal
quantitative
discrete
continuous

A population is finite if the number of its individuals is finite.
A population is infinite if we cannot determine the "exact" number of its individuals.

Hair color of hair salon customers  The answers are unordered qualities (It’s a qualitative nominal variable)

The level of customer satisfaction of a telephone operator  The answers (very dissatisfied / dissatisfied / satisfied / very satisfied) are qualities with a logical order (It’s an ordinal qualitative variable)

The number of people in Parisian households  the answers are numbers, and the set of answers is finite or countable (It’s a discrete quantitative variable)

The "exact" waiting time on the phone of customers before being answered by the technical service of an internet provider  the answers can be "any values" in an interval (It’s a continuous quantitative variable)

In this session, we will focus only on quantitative / measurable variables.

Also, note that unlike the first part of the course, we did not associate the adjective "random" with the term "variable".

Indeed, as mentioned in the foreword of the session, we are only interested in describing the data without imposing any "probabilistic framework".

Univariate data = Statistical series
A sequence of observations of a variable studied for all individuals in a population or a part of the population

Total number of observations = n
Number of individuals involved in the study

The data is usually collected in its raw state (without any particular organization / as a column in an Excel file), i.e. in the following form :
𝑥*1, 𝑥_2, …, 𝑥*𝑛
Where 𝑥_𝑖 is the "answer" of the i-th individual

A modality is a category of answers obtained/observed

Calculation of the mean

calculation of the variance

standard deviation

Exercise 1 :

The data below represent the scores (in math) obtained by n candidates in an entrance exam (for a management school)
8 15 11 12 7 10 16 18 9 11 3 13 14 17 7 8 12 13 16 15 9 15 7 11 9 14 17 8 12 8

We can deduce :

The number of candidates studied is equal to 29
A. True
B. False  
Feedback : recount again!!!

The average score (in math) of the candidates studied is equal to 11.
A. True
B. False  
Feedback : check the calculations using the formula for calculating the average when the data is represented in its raw state.

3. The standard deviation of the observed scores is approximately equal to 3.6583
   A. True
   B. False  
   Feedback : check the calculations using the formula for calculating the variance when the data is represented in its raw state.

4. Les notes des candidats étudiés tournent autour de la moyenne des notes.
   A. True
   B. False  
   Feedback : check the calculations of the mean and standard deviation in order to correctly interpret the coefficient of variation.

The table below represents the age distribution of 𝑛 (number not reported) voters in the last municipal election of a French city, denoted V.

We can deduce that :

The center of the last class is equal to 73.5 years
A. True
B. False  
Feedback : by convention, the last class has the same width as the class [35, 60[.

2.  The center of the first class is equal 19 years
    A. True
    B. False  
    Feedback : a voter must "by definition" be of age (in France) !!!

3.  The average age of 𝑛 voters in the last municipal election in City V is equal to 46.325 years.

          A. True
          B. False

    Feedback : check the calculations using the formula for calculating the mean when the data are from a continuous variable and represented in a table. Remember that frequencies are defined by :

𝑓*𝑖= 𝑛*𝑖/𝑛 4. The standard deviation of the age of 𝑛 voters in the last municipal election in city V is equal to 21.07681 years.
A. True
B. False  
Feedback : check the calculations using the formula for calculating the variance when the data are from a continuous variable and represented in a table. Remember that frequencies are defined by :

𝑓*𝑖= 𝑛*𝑖/𝑛
