The following questions are to be answered:

Does the time spent on social networks depend on the user's gender?
Is the effect of the treatment independent of the dose administered?
Is there a link between hair color and eye color?
Is there a link between marital status and job type?
Etc…

The Chi-square test is used to check the existence or not of a link between two characters in a given population:

When both characteristics are qualitative
When one characteristic is qualitative and the other is quantitative
When both characteristics are quantitative but the values have been grouped (in classes)

The first characteristic, designated by X, can be a quantitative or qualitative characteristic, with categories (or classes) [generally resulting from a grouping of the values of a quantitative characteristic or the modalities of a non-quantitative characteristic]. We will thus have the classes A1; … ;Ap
 X has p modalities

The second characteristic, designated by Y, can be a quantitative or qualitative characteristic, with categories (or classes) [generally resulting from a grouping of the values of a quantitative characteristic or the modalities of a non-quantitative characteristic]. We will thus have the classes B1; … ;Bq
 Y has q modalities

The purpose of the Chi-square test is to test:

    H0 : X and Y are independent
    	against
    H1 : X and Y are dependent

To do this, we take a sample from the population considered.
This sample of size n is represented by a contingency table of dimension p x q.

2. 1 Notations

ni,j represents the number of people who belong simultaneously to the category Ai of the dimension X and to the category Bj of the dimension Y

ni,. represents the sum of the numbers belonging to the category Ai of the dimension X

n.,j represents the sum of the numbers belonging to the category Bi of the dimension Y

2. 2 The formulas to perform the test
   We need to calculate the following expression (called Computed Chi-square):

Où

The test statistic uobs is therefore a comparison between the observed numbers and the theoretical numbers (Ei,j), i.e. the numbers under the hypothesis of independence.

Decision rule : We reject H0 if uobs ≥ k, otherwise we do not reject H0
 This implies: the rejection of the independence of the two characters X and Y

where
k is defined as follows F(k) = 1- α, with F is the distribution function of the Chi-square distribution with υ = (p – 1) x (q -1) degrees of freedom

k is calculated from the Chi-square distribution.

Condition of use : Ei,j ≥ 5 for all i = 1; …. ; p and j = 1; … ; q.
Note : when the previous conditions are not verified, it is necessary to gather classes in order to obtain sufficiently large numbers.

υ = (p – 1) x (q -1)

2. 3 Conclusion of the test

As a reminder, the test is written :
H0 : X and Y are independent
against
H1 : X and Y are dependent

H0 is rejected: the data confirm that the two variables are dependent
 This implies that there is a link between the two variables

H0 is not rejected: the data do not confirm that the two variables are dependent. In other words, the data do not confirm a link between the two variables at an α% risk.

An experimental anti-Covid treatment is administered at three different doses d1, d2, d3 to a group of subjects with Sars-Cov-2 virus. The experiment is done in double blind.
The number of subjects cured and the number of subjects not cured is counted for each dose.
The data are presented in the contingency table below:

We wish to test, with a 5% risk, if the effect of the treatment is dependent on the administered dose.

3. 1 Formulation of the test and notations
   H0 : independence of the "effect" and "dose" characteristics
   Against
   H1 : dependence of the "effect" and "dose" characteristics

The variable X is the "dose" character  So we have p =number of modalities of X = 3
The variable Y is the "effect" character  So we have q = number of modalities of Y = 2

3. 2 The formulas to perform the test
   Step 1 : Calculation of the theoretical numbers Ei,j
   In other words, Ei,j is equal to the product of the total of ith row by the total of the jth column, divided by the total number of individuals.

Example :
E1,1 = (𝑛*(1,.)×𝑛*(.,1) )/𝑛=(60×130 )/226=34,51

Recall that all values of Ei,j must be ≥ 5, otherwise it is necessary to aggregate classes in order to obtain sufficient calculated numbers.

3. 2 The formulas to perform the test
   Step 2 : Calculation of uobs

𝑢𝑜𝑏𝑠= ((30 −34,51)²)/34,51 + ((42 −44,29)²)/44,29+ ((58 −51,19)²)/51,19+
((30 −25,49)²)/25,49 + ((35 −32,71)²)/32,71 + ((31 −37,81)²)/37,81

𝑢𝑜𝑏𝑠 = 3,8

3. 3 Conclusion of the test

With a risk α = 5%, the H0 hypothesis is not rejected.

In other words, with a 5% risk, the data do not confirm a link between the effect of the treatment and the administered dose.

In the early 1970s, the association “Prévention Routière” wanted to encourage the French to wear seat belts. To do so, the association asked a polling institute to study the link between the nature of an injury following an accident and the wearing of a seat belt. A random sample of 10,779 drivers involved in an accident yielded the following results:

Can we say with a 5% risk, that there is a link between seat belt use and the nature of the injury? In other words, is the seat belt effective?

4. 1 Formulation of the test and notations
   H0 : independence of the character "Nature of injuries" and the character "Belt
   Against
   H1 : dependence of the character "Nature of injuries" and the character "Belt

The variable X is the character "Nature of the injury"  So we have p = number of modalities of X = 3
The variable Y is the character “Seatbelt"  So we have q = number of modalities of Y = 2

A marketing company selected a random sample of housewives (women under 50 years of age - the main shopper in the household) to study the link between the marital status of housewives and their weekly coffee consumption.
The results of this study are given in the following table:

Can we say, with a 5% risk, that there is a link between the level of coffee consumption and marital status among housewives?

1. Formulation of the test and notations
   H0 : independence of the "Marital status" and "Coffee consumption" characteristics
   Against
   H1 : dependence of the "Marital status" and "Coffee consumption" characteristics

The variable X is the character "Marital status”  So we have p = number of modalities of X = 3
The variable Y is the "Coffee consumption" character  So we have q = number of modalities of Y = 4

2. The formulas to perform the test
   Step 1 : Calculation of the theoretical numbers Ei,j

Ei,j ≥ 5

2. The formulas to perform the test
   Step 2 : Calculation of uobs

𝑢𝑜𝑏𝑠= ((652 −715,62)²)/715,62 + ….+ ((67 −57,96)²)/57,96
𝑢𝑜𝑏𝑠 = 67,78

distribution

with

α = 5% = 0,05
υ = (p – 1) x (q -1) = (3-1) x (4-1) = 2 x 3 = 6

So we have k = 12,592

3. Conclusion of the test

With a risk α = 5%, the H0 hypothesis is rejected.

In other words, with a 5% risk, the data confirm that there is a link between coffee consumption level and marital status among housewives.

After the general assembly, the students of the University U have decided to go on strike to protest against a new law. The management of the university believes that the support for this movement depends on the students' fields of study. In order to verify the management's claim, a random sample of 150 students (from the different streams) was selected. Thus, the investigator asked the selected students their opinions regarding the movement. The results of this study are given by the following table:
