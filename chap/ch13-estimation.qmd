Graphical representation of the Normal Distribution N(0;1

Let u be a real > 0 (unknown) and α a fixed probability. Assume that X follows N(0; 1). Let us denote 𝐹_𝑋 the distribution function of X.
We are looking for u, such as
𝑃(|𝑋| ≤𝑢)=𝑃(−𝑢 ≤𝑋 ≤𝑢)=1 − 𝛼  
𝑃(−𝑢 ≤𝑋 ≤𝑢)= 2 𝑃(𝑋 ≤𝑢)−1

It implies
𝐹*𝑋 (𝑢)=𝑃(𝑋 ≤𝑢)=1 − 𝛼/2
So we have
𝑢= 𝐹*𝑋^(−1) (1 − 𝛼/2)

Example :

Let X follow N(0; 1).
We look for the unknown real 𝑢 > 0, such that 𝑃(−𝑢 ≤𝑋 ≤𝑢)=0.95=1 −0.05
So we have,

𝑢= 𝐹*𝑋^(−1) (1 − 0.05/2) = 𝐹*𝑋^(−1) (0.975)

Using the table of the centered reduced normal distribution in an "inverted" way, we can deduce that

𝑢=1.96

The quality department of a factory, noted U, is interested in the average life of an electronic circuit, noted CE110, manufactured and marketed by the factory U.

Modeling framework :
From the problem, we must be able to identify :

The population : CE110 circuits
The variable studied : lifetime

To go further, we need a probabilistic framework

- Modeling assumption : the variable studied, noted X, follows a "𝔏" distribution

In other words, the variable studied on the population is a random variable (whose events are "controlled" by the distribution "𝔏")

Problem 1:

Modeling framework :
From the problem, we must be able to identify :

The population : CE110 circuits
The variable studied : lifetime

- Modeling assumption : the variable studied, noted X, follows a "𝔏" distribution

But this distribution "𝔏" is generally :

Totally unknown: we have no information
Partially unknown: we know to which family (of distributions) it belongs but we do not have its associated parameters

However, this lack of information about the "𝔏" distribution is not central to the problem we are dealing with  here, we are interested in the average life

Infer (definition):

Draw a conclusion from a fact or proposition

In philosophy:

Operation by which one passes from a set of premises (hypotheses) to a justified conclusion, made legitimate by these premises

Definition (academic):

A set of methods makes it possible to formulate (in probabilistic terms) a "judgment" on the characteristics of a population from the results observed on a part of the population.

Extension:

A set of "tools" that allow to generalize from a particular case

It is obvious that this passage will / can generate errors (of judgment) In other words, a risk of being wrong

Modeling framework reminder:

The population
The studied variable : X
Modeling assumption : the variable studied, noted X, follows a "𝔏" distribution

Sample (theoretical definition) :

𝑋*1, 𝑋_2, …, 𝑋*𝑛 n independent (two by two) and identically distributed variables (having the same distribution "𝔏")

Data set (the empirical or observed sample):

𝑥*1, 𝑥_2, …, 𝑥*𝑛 the realizations of the theoretical sample

Data Vs. Dataset:

When we use the term "data" we assume that a priori there is no "probabilistic hypothesis" concerning the observed values.

When we use the term "data set" we assume that a priori there is a "probabilistic hypothesis" concerning the observed values. In other words, the observed values are realizations (in relation to the characteristic under study) of a sequence of random experiments.

Let 𝑞 be the unknown parameter

𝑄 an estimator of 𝑞 is a function of the theoretical sample (i.e., a function of variables 𝑋*1, 𝑋_2, …, 𝑋*𝑛)
 it is a random variable
𝑄=ℎ(𝑋*1, 𝑋_2, …, 𝑋*𝑛)

𝑞 ̂ estimate of 𝑞 is the image of the associated estimator, via the data set

𝑞 ̂ =ℎ(𝑥*1, 𝑥_2, …, 𝑥*𝑛)

Exercise 1 :

A store manager wants to study the average amount spent by his customers. To do this, he selected (at random) 40 customers and measured the amount spent by them.
Please find below the results of this study:

30.18 33.29 30.86 26.86 36.52 31.61 28.07 32.61 28.31 30.21
31.72 32.45 31.34 31.19 35.12 29.99 32.55 30.12 30.85 29.52
31.06 33.29 35.15 29.17 32.01 32.42 31.82 33.86 32.25 29.87
32.24 28.98 31.25 30.24 27.92 32.01 28.74 28.24 32.51 28.21

Thus, we can deduce that:

Feedback : 31.11525 is the empirical mean

3.  2.086953 is an estimate of the standard deviation of the amount spent by store customers
    A. True
    B. False  
    Feedback : check the calculations using the formula for calculating the variance when the data are represented in their raw state.

4.  The probability that the average amount spent by customers in the store is between 30.4685 and 31.762, is equal to 95%.
    A. True
    B. False  
    Feedback : check the calculations using the formula for calculating the confidence interval of a mean with a confidence level of 95%.

Exercise 2

The manager of a shopping mall is interested in the rate of visitors buying from the mall. To do so, he asked the following question: "Did you buy something during your visit?" to 70 (randomly selected) visitors of the mall. The results of this study are presented below:

Positive answer = 1
Negative answer = 0
Thus, we can deduce that:

47.14% is an estimate of the mall's shopper rate.
A. True
