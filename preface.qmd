# Preface {.unnumbered}

I have written this website form book in order to fully embrace statistics
and modeling. This is a personnal project spanning for several months
(years?). It took me uncountable number of hour of reading materials and
studying to figure out the chapters arrangement 

I took the opportunity to build this book interactive as possible, using 
the capabilities that websites provides. Hence, a physical copy of this
book is, in my opinion, impossible to replicate the same experience.

I hope you find the content useful.

## But wait, I understant statistics... but what is statistical modeling?

A model is a **simplified version of a part of the real world** in which
precise calculations are possible. A model is therefore a mathematical
tool to help us understand the world around us. It enables our limited
brains to grasp real-life situations that are so complex they cannot be
fully comprehended. Additionally, models introduce a layer of abstraction
that provides a "simplified version of reality" [@gowersMathematicsVeryShort2002].

While this list is not exhaustive, most statistical models falls into at
least one of these 3 categories [@kuhnTidyModelingFramework2022]:

1. Descriptive
2. Inferential
3. Predictive

## Descriptive Models

The purpose of a descriptive model is to describe or illustrate
characteristics of some data. The analysis might have no other purpose
than to visually emphasize some trend or artifact in the data [@kuhnTidyModelingFramework2022].

Organizing and summarizing data is called descriptive statistics. Two
ways to summarize data are by graphing and by using numbers (for example,
average) [@illowskyIntroductoryStatistics2e2023].

## Inferential Models

The goal of an inferential model is to produce a decision for a research
question or to explore a specific hypothesis, similar to how statistical tests
are used

An inferential model starts with a predefined conjecture, or idea, about
a population and produces a statistical conclusion such as an interval
estimate or the rejection of a hypothesis. For example, the goal of a
clinical trial might be to provide confirmation that a new therapy does
a better job in prolonging life than an alternative.

Inferential model uses probability to determine how confident you can be
that your conclusions are correct. Effective interpretation of data
(inference) is based on good procedures for producing data and thoughtful
examination of the data.

## Predictive Models

Sometimes data are modeled to produce the most accurate prediction
possible for new data.

For this type of model, the problem type is one of **estimation** rather
than inference. For example, the buyer is usually not concerned with a
question such as “Will I sell more than 100 copies of book X next month?”
but rather “How many copies of book X will customers purchase next month?

### Mechanistic Models

### Empirically driven Models

Empirically driven models are created with more vague assumptions. These
models tend to fall into the machine learning category. A good example is
the _K_-nearest neighbor (KNN) model. Given a set of reference data, a
new sample is predicted by using the values of the $K$ most similar data
in thereference set.
